What kind of models do you have?

3 or 4 different kinds of models and depending on the material, you select the model.

So one of the models is called as a trend model.

So on the x axis, you typically have your timeline.

So January, February, March, so on.

And over here you typically have your consumption £100, £1,000, whatever.

The trend model tries to look at the historic consumption based on a trend.

It's increasing or decreasing or whatever, and then tries to follow that trend.

That's called as a trend model.

So for trend model to be successful, you need at least.

Three periods.

So for January, the consumption is so much for February, the consumption is so much for March, the

consumption is so much.

What is the consumption for April?

The trend model can predict it.

Now, the problem with trend model is trend model cannot take care of seasonality.

Right?

So January, February, March, April.

The trend is.

Like so.

But come December, the trend is different.

So trend model typically is used for materials that have fairly constant demand during the entire year,

and the demand can be predicted using some kind of a model, meaning it could be a straight line, it

could be a curve, it doesn't matter as long as the previous three periods can systematically determine

what is the next month's consumption.

If it's a new product that you're trying to sell and you want to do for that product.

This is probably a better approach because you don't know what's going to happen in seasonality.

You don't care.

You don't even know because you don't have so much of data.

So for new products.

Trend model is probably a better choice.

Then there is another model called seasonal model.

A seasonal model.

Typically seasons happen once or twice a year.

Right.

So a seasonal model.

Predicts trends or predicts consumption based on season.

So you have your.

Jan, Feb, March, April, May, June.

Say the peak is in summer.

And in winter.

The consumption goes down and it's a pattern.

How do you know that pattern if you have at least?

12 or 13 months of data, which means that if you have the data for the last year, entire year.

Then you basically know what the seasonality is going to be and based on that, SAP is going to predict.

Or forecast how much it's going to require in Jan, Feb, March, April, May, June.

So what is the consumption for Jan?

What is the consumption for February?

How about summer?

Winter?

It automatically predicts the trend because it knows that in summer the production is high because last

year it was high.

Another model, which is fairly constant, is called the constant model.

Right.

So if the amount of consumption is fairly constant, you can just go for the constant model.

So these are some of the main prediction models.

So what you're trying to do is predict based on past consumption.

If you have new products, go with the trend model.

If you already have a lot of history, say one year's history and you know that the history follows

a seasonal pattern, then go with the seasonal model.

And if the demand is fairly constant, then you go with the constant model.

So.

Coffee.

Our coffee beans typically fall in the constant model.

Things like pumpkin spice.

You guys had the pumpkin spice latte in Starbucks, right?

It's only available in winter or during the holiday season, so pumpkin spice can be modeled using the

seasonal approach.

For new products.

Let us say you start a new latte.

Go with the trend model.
