- **[Sub-section 2: Common Errors & Fixes]**  

  **1. Posting Period Issue (Material Accounting Period Closed)**  
  - Error: **"Posting only possible in periods 2006/11."**  
  - Cause: Training system is **10 years behind** in accounting periods.  
  - Fix:  
    - Open **MMRV** or **MMPV** transaction.  
    - Update to **current period (e.g., 01/2016)**.  

  **2. Storage Location Missing**  
  - Error: **"Enter a storage location."**  
  - Cause: Goods receipt requires a **storage location (e.g., warehouse or section in the plant).**  
  - Fix:  
    - Select an appropriate **Storage Location (e.g., 0001 - Raw Materials Storage).**  
    - Can be based on **material type or warehouse location** (e.g., Flour stored separately from coffee beans).  

  **3. Finance Posting Period Issue**  
  - Error: **"Posting period for financial accounting is closed."**  
  - Cause: Finance module (FI) requires period updates, similar to Material Management (MM).  
  - Fix:  
    - Open **OB52** transaction.  
    - Update **Company Code (e.g., 3000)** to **current fiscal year (2016)**.

- **Errors related to posting periods (Material & Finance) must be fixed before proceeding.**  
- **A valid storage location must be entered** to complete the goods receipt process.  
- **Once posted, SAP generates a Material Document Number, confirming receipt.**
