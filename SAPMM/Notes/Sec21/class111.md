And examples of receipts or against Poe.

So with a Poe or without a Poe, these are some of the most used examples.

Now, there are also examples of receipts.

Where a production order is complete for £10 of cake and you receive the goods against.

Production order.

That uses a certain movement type.

Now, do you need to remember that?

Well, not necessarily.

Now, there are so many different movement types, right, that use just just assume that that uses

a different movement type.

Now against.

A project.

A project produces certain deliverables, physical goods like it.

It created a generator.

You want to put it in stock?

Sure.

Against a project, you could receive goods.

Similarly against a sales order.

If the customer sent back the copy saying it's stale, you receive the goods against that sales orders

delivery.

So most of the issues will typically have some kind of returns and they can all be done using goods,

receipts or some kind of reversal.

So to 21 is against stock to 22 could be a reversal of issuing goods against the stock, which is a

receipt.

Right now.

What is the take away from this screen for you?

I've got this complicated screen with so many different issues, so many different receipts and other

processes like sampling, scrapping, converting from one material to another.

What is the takeaway?

The takeaway is.

There are three categories of processes that happen in the warehouse purely in terms of inventory management.

You receive goods against different references, against a PO, without a PO, against a production

order, against a project, so on and so forth.

So these are all examples of receipts.

They increase the stock.

And what do you do with the stock?

You don't keep it with you all the time.

You have to either issue it or.

Scrap it.

When you do issues, you issue it against internal order, you issue it for you, issue it against a

cost center, sales order project.

Asset production order.

They'll reduce the stock.

So this will increase the stock.

This will reduce the stock.

And if you don't sell that much, you got to scrap the stock or convert it into different material if

you're able to sell it.

So these are some internal processes.

These are inbound.

We are receiving the goods and these are outbound where we are issuing the goods either into our own

warehouse for manufacturing something or out of our warehouse, out of our hands to customers.

Again, the whole purpose of this slide is to understand that goods keep coming in.

They use different movement types.

Goods keep going out.

They use different movement types.

And internally you could transfer or do some kind of juggling or manipulation of goods.

They use different kinds of movement types.

Like I said, you don't need to remember all the movement types.

Unnecessary 5 or 10 different movement types at most and remember them by doing the transactions.

There is no need for you to get them by heart.

Just remember those 4 or 5 different movement types and that's good enough.

But understand that a movement type basically represents either a physical or virtual movement of goods.

In case of conversion.

This is an example of virtual movement.

In case of scrapping, this is an example of virtual movement.

Or sometimes it's physical movement, like moving or issuing goods against a sales order.

When you do that, goods are physically transferred over to the customer.

Now let's just see one more example of movement type called non-destructive sampling.

So this is an example of sampling, right?

Where we destroyed £1 of coffee.

And the movement type was three, three, three.
