Now, when you do this conversion right from first gate to second grade, how do you know that it's

time to convert?

You have some matrix, right?

You do some kind of QA quality analysis.

And determine that it's no longer relevant for first grade.

Let's shift it to second grade.

So in order to do that.

You got to be able to do some level of pick up some material from the Lord and do your quality analysis.

This kind of quality analysis or QA sampling.

Okay, I'll put it under issues because this is something that we are trying to remove from the stack.

So one type of issue is QA sampling.

And the movement type for that I think is also somewhere in the three hundreds.

So let's go do that.

So what are we going to do?

We're going to do a good issue.

Uh, foreign material.

Coffee beans.

Oh one.

Let's say, a very small quantity.

We don't want to really take a, you know, ten kilos, but maybe £1.

Okay.

Where do you want to do it?

You want to use.

Movement type.

Go somewhere to the three hundreds and starting with.

Yeah.

This one.

Withdrawal from sampling for quality inspection.

So from sampling.

For quality inspection and we are doing that from unrestricted use from Chicago plant, from coffee

beans, storage location.

Okay, so this is withdrawal for sampling.

Just click check, make sure everything is okay and save.

Now if you go back.

So we have 105 here.

We have withdrawn £1 of coffee for sampling.

Go back here.

It should be 104.

Oh, looks like it's picked up up from quality inspection.

So 331 is a movement type from quality stock for sampling if you want to do it for unrestricted stock.

I think you should be able to do.

Somewhere in that number range.

Go to the 300 number range and 331 was withdrawal from quality stock.

Uh 332 withdrawal for sampling from quality stock.

That's a reversal from unrestricted stock.

So try 333.

At 333 from Plant Chicago, one in storage location, coffee beans.

And what do you want to do?

We want to withdraw coffee beans.

Oh one.

How much?

£1.

Not more than that.

Okay.

Now do a check, make sure everything is okay.

Click save.

If you go here now, stock of £1 is being withdrawn for quality inspection from unrestricted stock.

So 105 should go down to 104.

Let's check that.

There you go.

So 331 was to remove from quality inspection stock and 333 is to remove from unrestricted use.

Well, we don't want to remember all the movement times anyway, so I'll put 333.

That's issuing goods for sampling.
