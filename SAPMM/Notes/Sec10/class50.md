 
The next topic is procuring  non stock material.

So the first question that you might have is what is a non-stock material?

And of course, the follow up question is why is procuring stock material or non stock material any

different from one another?

Let's explore that in our coffee shop.

We procure coffee beans.

We also procure stirrers.

Is procuring coffee beans any different from procuring steroids?

Well, purely from a logistics perspective, they're not different.

Maybe they require separate storage conditions, separate packaging.

But beyond that, purely from a logistics perspective, they're not different.

The vendor loads them up in the truck.

The truck is unloaded at our warehouse and we go stock them in the respective storage locations.

So what really is different?

Well, for starters.

Coffee beans represent a significant value.

£100 of coffee beans.

Say $10 a pound, £100 of coffee beans is $1,000.

But 100 quantity or 1000 quantity of stirrers is probably 10 or $20.

So there's a lot of difference in the value.

So purely in terms of stock keeping, it doesn't make any sense to count the stirrers.

Oh, I got 1002 hundred stirrers.

I got 222 Stirrers.

This makes sense.

No, it's just a waste of time and energy to count the value of steroids or even the stock of steroids.

And before we go any further, since we are talking about a topic called valuation, let's take a quick

detour and understand what really is valuation.
