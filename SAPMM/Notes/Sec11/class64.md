Below is a summary of the exercise questions and their answers:

1. **Can you create a service line item without a cost element?**  
   - **Answer:** No. Every service line item must include a cost element (via account assignment, such as a cost center) because someone (e.g., a department) must absorb the cost.

2. **Which item category is used for service materials?**  
   - **Answer:** The item category for services is **D**.

3. **What is necessary to enter additional line items in the service entry sheet?**  
   - **Answer:** You must set a limit (e.g., an overall monetary limit such as $100) on the line item in the purchase order. Without this limit, you cannot enter unplanned additional service items in the service entry sheet.

4. **For service items, when does accounting occur – during goods receipt or during the service entry sheet?**  
   - **Answer:** Accounting occurs during the **service entry sheet** process. (A service entry sheet effectively creates a dummy goods receipt behind the scenes.)

5. **What is the transaction code for ServiceMaster?**  
   - **Answer:** The transaction code is **AC03**.

6. **What is the transaction code for the Service Entry Sheet?**  
   - **Answer:** The transaction code is **ML81N**.

7. **What are the disadvantages of using analog (non-stock) material for procuring services?**  
   - **Answer:** Using analog material for services is disadvantageous because it:
     - Breaks the direct link between the purchase order and the receipt.
     - Lacks an elegant way to add additional service items at the line item level.
     - Does not properly capture the unique attributes of a service (like labor hours and service phases).

8. **Which combinations are possible for maintaining service material prices?**  
   - **Answer:** There are three possible approaches:
     - **Base Price:** A standard price for the service material.
     - **Price by Vendor:** Different vendors can have different prices for the same service.
     - **Price by Vendor and Plant Combination:** Prices can be set based on both vendor and plant, allowing location-specific pricing.

9. **Is there a need for the user to create a separate material document for service materials?**  
   - **Answer:** No. For service materials, there is no need to create a material document manually; the service entry sheet process automatically generates the necessary material document (using a dummy material) behind the scenes.

These answers reinforce the distinctions between how standard, non-stock, and service materials are handled in SAP—especially emphasizing the special requirements for service procurement.
