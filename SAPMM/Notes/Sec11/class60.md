 
Copy the PO.

Double click.

Copy.

Now.

Do we do a goods receipt?

No, we don't do a goods receipt instead.

Close this tab and go to the service entry sheet.

So for services, you use service entry sheet for regular physical goods, use a goods receipt.

Goods receipt was a service entry sheet, so you would have to remember this services use service entry

sheet.

Physical goods use.

Goods receipt.

So we are not going to go to my go and do a goods receipt.

Instead, we are going to go to the service entry sheet.

Go click on Maintain.

So a service entry is just a fancy term again, for recording services that are being performed.

So some services are being performed like a basic electric service.

Advanced Electric service.

Labor.

So what are they being performed against?

Against a PO.

What is a PO?

Well, it's in our clipboard, so we're going to paste it here.

Where are we going?

To paste it.

We should refer it somewhere, right?

We refer it here.

Enter your purchase order number and click okay.

That's easy, right?

And then we're going to click on the new button here so it creates a new entry sheet.

So click on New.

And select your services.

And we're going to give it a description pump.

Repair.

Or it could be something else.

Any kind of description.

And what are the services that we have ordered?

We have ordered for a basic electric service, right?

You selected a PIO, but the services have not come in from the PIO yet.

So in order for the services from the PIO to come in, you have to select those services.

So click on this button.

And.

Click.

Okay.

So this is the service that we've asked for, right?

So copy those services into our service entry sheet.

The only item that we have ordered is a basic electric service.

And that's for one hour.

If you look at this line, line number ten.

There's a check mark here.

This means that it's a planned service.

So we have already planned for it.

Where did we plan for it?

Right at the time of creating a PO.

So at the time of creating a PO, we know that we needed a pump repair.

We know the vendor and we know that it's going to require roughly one hour of electric service.

So that's a planned service.

Now the electrician has come in.

And he is going to perform all the steps that we discussed in the other slide.

What are the steps?

These steps, some basic problem identification and then spare parts, identification, you know, fixing

the problem, cleaning service, all different kinds of services.

But we have ordered only for the basic electric service.

How do we add more services?

Right.

That's the real reason why we have come here instead of doing it in the goods receipt.

So we cannot add more items at the line item level and goods receipt.

So we are using a service center sheet for that.

This is SAP's way of entering services.

Can we enter them here like so.

So electric service, not zero one, but zero two.

The quantity of one hit enter.

Can we do that?

Whoops.

We have a problem here.

If you cannot enter an unplanned service.

What's the fun in doing this in a service entry sheet?

We have the same problem as we have in Miko Gerd's receipt.

Right.

Or is it really a problem?

Well, the reason why we cannot enter an unplanned services here.

Is because at the time of creating a.

We have to plan for it.

Well, it's not that complicated.

I'm going to tell you.

So let's abandon this guy.

Cancel.

Do you want to cancel the maintenance?

Yes.

Go back.

Go to M-22 and open the same that we have created.

And over here.

Go to the limits tab and the line item level.

And here you can put a limit.

For now, we have said that we require $10 or one hour worth of service.

But there could be more services that are required, right?

Like advanced installation, manual labor, so on and so forth.

So we're going to set a limit of $100.

So $100 is the limit and it's going to be going against the admin cost center.

So any time we do a service, we need somebody to eat that service.

And this guy admin department is going to eat the cost of that service.

So we have set an overall limit of $100.

There are many ways to set the limit, like no limit or limits by contract, but we're not going to

go there.

Just set an overall limit of $100.

And what does that mean?

That means that the electrician or the vendor is free to perform any kind of service.

Until a limit of $100.

Although we have originally said that the purchase order is for $10.

We are giving leeway to the electrician or the vendor because we don't really know what is required

to repair that pump.

Now let's save this.

Go back and.

Maintain a service center sheet again.

What is the service entry sheet for?

It's for this purchase order that we have just entered.

Hit enter.

And we are going to create a new entry service entry sheet for pump repair.

We're going to adopt the items from the purchase order.

Click on this button.

Enter the purchase order number line item there.

Click.

Okay.

And the first line item is a basic electric service.

Well, that's a planned service.

We are happy with it, but the electrician is going to say, I need to do an advanced electric service

like an installation.

Okay.

Sure.

Go ahead.

Create them.

And the price for that is going to be $20.

Sure, no problem.

See, this time, SAP did not object.

It said okay.

It made an entry.

And as you can see, this is an unplanned service.

What do I mean by unplanned?

It's unplanned with reference to the purchase order.

So originally when I'm the owner, I said I need a pump repair.

I didn't know that it's going to require an advanced electric service.

I only said, okay, one hour of service.

But after the electrician has come in, he's seen this.

He thought that an advanced electric service is required.

Okay, we're going to enter that during the service entry sheet.

And maybe you require labor, right?

Labor zero one quantity of one at a price of, say, $10 per hour.

And that's also an unplanned service.

So the electrician say is happy with it.

He has fixed the problem.

Now we go verify it and somebody has to approve it.

Right, because there is no stock to really show what we have paid for.

It's a service, right?

So somebody has to really approve a service.

That was not the case with goods receipt with goods receipt, because we have goods to show for in the

warehouse.

Nobody needs to prove it.

As long as this appeal, you can go to a good seat somewhere in the warehouse will go do a goods receipt.

But a service always needs to be approved by an authority.

A manager or somebody who is superior has to approve that the service has been performed so you can

save the service entry sheet.

That means that the service has been performed.

All good.

But that's not the end of service entry.

Somebody has to accept it.

So you can save this.

And now a manager has to accept it.

Right.

Let's say I'm the manager.

And I go to change mode and you see this.

The service entry sheet is not accepted yet.

That's why you see no acceptance here.

If I'm the manager, I can just go here and click accept and click Save.

Now the service entry sheet is really complete.

So we have procured a basic electric service, an advanced electric service and a manual labor.
