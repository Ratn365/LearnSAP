If you go to zero three.

What material?

Coffee beans, let's say.

Go to the views.

Put the plant in.

And you see the lot size there in one.

The lot size dictates how to plan the procurement.

The lot size dictates how to do the procurement.

Looks at the lot size and does adjustments to the elements like planned orders, production orders.

Now here you might be a little bit confused.

So for.

Well, not just you.

There are so many different parameters.

One is the type.

The second is procurement type is a very complicated process.

It has so many different parameters.

I'm trying to oversimplify things for you here so that you can understand step by step.

And we as consultants do not need to understand everything in MRP because MRP is more relevant, like

I said, for consultants.

For consultants.

We only need to be worried about CBP.

Consumption based planning.

But irrespective of the planning that we do, consumption based planning or forecast based planning

or any other kind of planning.

The process of planning is run through MRP.

So we are learning some of the basics of MRP.

If you really want to learn, you should go talk to your consultant.

All right.

So, like I said, needs three parameters.

MRP type.

Procurement type.

And third lot size.

Let's take one example.

We have set the type to VB, which is manual reorder point based planning, and we said we need £500.

We have set the procurement type to say external.

And we have set the lot size to x lot per lot.

When runs it looks at the type first.

That's probably the most important parameter.

And before it even goes there, of course it looks at the dirty flags.

That's a different story.

But assuming has to run, the flags are dirty First it looks at the type.

What type of planning should be done for this material.

So this is a primary parameter for planning.

So type dictates how the material should be planned.

Is it planned based on reorder point?

Is it planned based on forecasting?

So many different types of planning.

And after that, the second parameter is the procurement type.

How should you procure goods?

Okay.

There is a requirement for 400 based on the type of planning.

Now, are they being produced or are they being procured?

If they are being procured externally, it creates purchase requisitions.

If they are being produced internally, it creates planned orders.

So that is the second parameter.

So procurement type, the name is pretty clear.

That is the second parameter looks at.

The third parameter is the lot size.

Okay.

Let's say I'm procuring them externally.

What should be the quantity?

So large size is really important.

Think of this.

My home needs £10 of wheat.

That's what my brain has decided based on what's there in the pantry.

Now is wheat available in all denominations.

Let's say I don't want to go to the supermarket, but I want to order it on Amazon.

So what are the denominations in which it is economical for me to order, say, for example?

If I order £1, the cost is going to be $4 per pound.

If I order £10, say the cost is going to be $3 per pound.

If I order £100, the cost is going to be $2 per pound.

Which lot size should I choose?

That depends on the material.

And if you are producing them or procuring them internally and that intelligence is being put in the

lot size.

Now, a car is not produced in lots, right?

Honda Accord is produced one piece at a time.

So the lot size for that is just one.

Wheat coffee.

Say, for example, if they're procured externally.

Could be procured in bags.

50 kilo bags.

100 kilo bags.

And if purchase orders allow more discounts, you could say, okay, go for bigger lots.

Sometimes it's not economical to produce one purchase order per requirement.

In which case we can go and change the purchase requisition based on the lot size.

Like increasing the quantity of an existing purchase order or purchase requisition or purchase requisition.

So a lot size plays a role in determining the final order.

What should be my quantity?

What's the effective way to procure or produce this amount of quantity?

Should I change an existing element like existing purchase requisition or existing plant order?

Or should I create new ones?

It depends on the lot size.

And like I said, the way you create a purchase order for a wheat.

The way you create purchase order for coffee, the way you create purchase order for a car, the way

you create purchase order for a coffee machine.

These are all entirely different.

And when you plan that material, the planner also has to look at the lot size.

So three parameters MRP type procurement type and lot size.

These three things mainly dictate how MSPs run from a consumption perspective.

Now, each of these has so many options, like lot size has x, f x.

So on procurement type as e, FX1 for external and internal, both type has so many different types

reorder point based planning.

Forecast based planning.

I'm only here talking about consumption based planning types.

There are so many other types of planning.

Sales order based planning.

Demand based planning.

We're not going there.

Point being, just remember these three parameters for now type procurement, type, lot size and understand

why each of these parameters are used.
