Now assuming you have enough stock.

If a reservation has been made.

You have to go deliver them, right?

Somebody in the warehouse would have to issue the goods against the reservation.

I need £100 of coffee by the 30th of January.

And when the 30th of January comes, somebody in the warehouse would have to issue that £100 of coffee.

This can be done manually, of course, you know, just by putting in the reservation like we have just

done.

Do a good issue against reservation in my go and goods can be issued.

Now if there are many such requirements.

The person sitting in the warehouse would not know that there is a reservation against which he has

to issue the goods.

So in order to systematically assist the warehouse manager to understand what are all the issues that

he has to do against reservations.

There is something called as a pick list.

Pick.

List.

What is a pick list?

A pick list is a list of all the materials and quantities that has to be picked for issues.

For example.

On Jan first.

You have created a reservation for £100 of coffee.

Coffee beans oh one, let's say.

To be delivered on.

Jan.

Second, let's say, tomorrow and again.

First again, there is another reservation somebody else has created for coffee beans oh two to be delivered

on Jan second and on Jan third.

So on, Jan, first, again, there is £100 of coffee.

Of coffee beans oh one, let's say.

To be required on Jan third.

There are so many line items like that, right?

So many people require so many things.

All of them are recorded as reservations now on Jan second.

The person in the warehouse would not have a clue.

What are all the issues that he has to do?

Now, you might be wondering, why does he need to know?

The reason why he needs to know is he has to plan for those issues.

No, it's a small warehouse.

Like a coffee shop.

That's not a big deal.

It's easy.

Oh, I need 100 points of coffee.

Okay.

Go pick that bag.

Well, like I said, if I have ten coffee shops in Chicago and all of them are serviced by one plant,

in that case, the warehouse is really big.

You got like £50,000 of coffee.

Different types of coffee.

Where is coffee beans?

Even, let's say dark roast Arabica.

It's somewhere on that corner in the third aisle.

Fourth row, fifth bin.

Right.

In which case it's not easy to just issue goods.

It takes time.

So on Jan second, when the warehouse manager comes into the warehouse, it would be nice if he gets

a list that tells him that on January 2nd I need coffee beans.

Oh one.

Hundred pounds.

Coffee beans or two?

£200.

Oh, this is not on Jan second.

This list will come on third.

So, so on and so forth.

Anything that's due for issue on the second.

The materials and quantities.

That's called a picklist.

So based off of that picklist, he goes, picks all the goods and then puts it in a staging area.

And from that point on, all the issues will be issued when the person who requires the goods comes

in.

One particular employee needs.

£100 of coffee on the second.

So he comes in Jan second, say 12:00 in the noon and his delivery is ready.

Somebody else comes in at 4:00 in the afternoon.

His delivery is ready.

The baker comes in for an ad hoc request for £10 of coffee.

His delivery is ready.

That can only be done if the warehouse manager has a pick list.

It's basically a way to plan all the issues.

And a picklist is 26.

You can do it based off of reservation.

You can do it based off of material.

You can do it based off of an order.

Asset plant sales order.

Based off of any of these selection criteria.

And if you hit execute, it should show you a list from which you can do picking really easily.

I'll show you how.

For example, in this case I have to pick £100 or £113 of coffee today.

Right?

Which storage location?

Let's say coffee storage location.

So we enter the storage location.

And.

See.

The goods movement is posted, meaning from a pick list, you would not even have to go to my go.

Your goods movement is already posted.

If you want to go check that.

Go to the reservation.

Remember, this is for 113 quantity, right?

You see this flag is checked on.

What does that tell you?

That tells you that the final issue is done.

Right.

So from the picklist without having to go to go, you can do the goods issue.

All you have to do is put the storage location from which you are picking the goods and click save.

Now this picklist can also be printed so that, you know, you can have a little printout of all the

materials that you need to pick.

Send somebody to go pick all the materials from the racks, put it in an area where you can really do

something like pack it or keep it ready, stack it, that kind of thing.
