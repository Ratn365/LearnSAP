The first thing you have to understand is how do you add new line items during goods receipt?

You can do that using the Add.

Non ordered.

Items.

In my go.

That way you can add ad hoc items that you are taking delivery of without a purchase order from a vendor.

Use.

Movement type 101.

Configure.

Movement type 101 in OMG.

For automatic procreation.

Not just that you have to assign a default purchase organization to the plant in enterprise structure.

Assign default.

PIO to plant.

So in this case, we have assigned the purchase order us zero one as default for the plant.

Chicago.

Not just that, we have to mark.

Both material master.

Vendor master as.

Automatic relevant.

Not just that, we have to also create a purchase info record for the material master Vendor master.

If you do all these steps, then when you create a goods receipt without a corresponding purchase order,

the system will automatically generate a PO for you.

Now, from this point onwards, you can use that PO to pay for the goods because there is a price.

You can automatically receive the invoice and pay the vendor.

Now you might have a question here.

Why even create a PO?

Do we have to go through all this trouble to create a PO automatically?

Why don't we just receive the goods and pay for the goods?

Well, the reason is tracking.

We have taken an ad hoc delivery, which is good, which serves the purpose of the business.

But we have to also ensure that there are documents to track it.

So six months down the line, if somebody asks you what was this Â£100 of flour received against?

We would not understand.

We would lose track.

But if you use the auto functionality, the goods are tracked, the invoice is tracked and the payment

can be tracked.

That is the reason why the auto functionality can be used.
