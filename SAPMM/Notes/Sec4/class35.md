2. **Invoice Posting also needs exclusive number ranges** → Assign new interval numbers to avoid conflicts.  
3. **Checking Stock in MMBE ensures material is successfully received**.  
4. **Key SAP Transactions Used**:  
   - **FBN1** → Assigning Number Ranges.  
   - **MMBE** → Checking Stock Levels.  
   - **MIGO** → Goods Receipt Processing.  
   - **MIRO** → Invoice Posting.
