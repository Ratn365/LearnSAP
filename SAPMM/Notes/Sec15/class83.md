So this is our successful bidder, right?

So control y.

Copy the quotation number.

Go back.

The first thing we are going to do is create an info record.

The way to create that info record is if you go to the price comparison.

Put the collective number of 21.

Click Execute.

And select that line item, go to quotation.

And if you say update info record.

And you want to say update.

You want and you want this to be the price for Chicago plant only or for all the other plants.

Well, for now, we have asked the goods to be delivered to the Chicago plant.

So.

Select B, which is update with plant.

Right.

And click on Save.

So for Vendor 4003, we have created an info record.

Right?

And let's go create a purchase order.

Go to purchase order.

Go to create a May 21st N and select 4003.

Coffee beans.

Quantity of 100.

Right.

Hit enter.

Enter.

Go to conditions and you see the 895.

Where did it get it from?

From the info record.

Did we create the info record?

No.

When the quotation was saved with the info record update as be.

The system has automatically created an info record.

If you want to see that analysis, if you want to see that info record, let's just go back.

Oh, okay.

So you can go to info records, right?

Where are info records?

Go to master data info record display and for 4003 coffee beans.

Is there an info record?

Yes, there is an info record.

Go to conditions and you see the 885.

So this is an automatic creation because we have said.

Because we have asked the quotation to be auto updated and we do it only for the successful bidder anyway.

Right?

All right.

So that was the so that was step number one.

So that was step number one.

This is successfully done.

We were able to test it by creating a pool.

The second step is.

You can convert that.

You can convert that quotation into a contract.

How do you do that?

It's basically it's very simple.

You go to outline agreement.

Contract.

Create.

Then you refer to an RFQ and then then you refer to an RFQ.

Select that and go here.

Put the collective number.

And this is the successful bidder, right?

Select that.

And click okay.

So the vendor is automatically pulled.

Dates are pulled, the plant is pulled, the purchase org is pulled.

All you need to do is select the type of contract.

Say we want a quantity contract.

Enter and it's valid for a month or one year.

The quantity is 1000.

And you can adapt those details from the RFQ or you could change the quantities here.

3000.

Right.

This is assuming that the vendor is ready to supply not just 1000, but 3000, 5000, 10,000, Â£20,000

of coffee at that price.

That's something you got to confirm with the vendor before you create a contract at that price as a

source of supply.

Right.

So the price, again is automatically pulled from where?

From the RFQ.

Then you can click Save.

And this contract now is a source of supply.

So step number two.

Is complete.

You have created a contract now with reference to the contract if you create a PO.

Of course you're going to get all the conditions and prices into the PO.

And creating a scheduling agreement is also similar.

Right.

It's also an outline agreement.

Like a contract.

So creating a scheduling agreement is as simple as clicking on create vendor unknown and reference to

an RFQ and put the RFQ number in there and everything else is pulled into it.

Just select the correct agreement type scheduling agreement.

And then put a validity end date.

Say one year and you can adopt the RFQ like this for a quantity of 1000.

5000?

4000 Doesn't matter.

Right?

The vendor is ready to supply an infinite amount at that price.

You could very well put any amount you want.

And then click Save.

That's a scheduling agreement.

And you know further how to deal with the scheduling agreement.

You can create a delivery schedule and based on the delivery schedule, goods will be received on that

particular date.

As you can see, the quotation process starts as a competition between the different vendors.

You send them request for quotation.

They respond with quotations and you select a winner.

Once you select a winner.

You can create that as a source of supply.

Basically, you're creating that vendor and the conditions under which he's ready to deliver the goods

to us, meaning the price, the incoterms payment terms, delivery dates, etcetera, into a source

of supply.

And what are the possible sources of supply?

The three main sources of supply are purchasing for record contract scheduling agreement.

You can create any of these or all of these.

And any time in the future you require coffee.

You can either create a purchase order directly because the purchase info record already contains the

price and the vendor.

Or you can create a purchase order with reference to a contract if you have created a contract or a

scheduling agreement.

So basically this brings three processes together.

The quotation process or the RFQ process, the source of supply, which contains a list of source documents

like purchase info, record contract scheduling agreements that can be used to create further documents

with the vendor.

This whole procedure brings two concepts together.

The first concept.

Is the RFQ process where you start off with an RFQ and then end in a successful quotation.

And number two, you create a source of supply based on the successful quotation.

And a source of supply essentially consists of a purchasing record or a contract or a scheduling agreement.

In the next chapter, we're going to summarize all the different documents that we have done so far

and see how they are linked together.
