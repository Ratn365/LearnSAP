In this chapter.

We're going to talk about blanket purchase order.

What is a blanket purchase order?

And why would you use a blanket purchase order?

To understand this.

Let's say the Chicago headquarters has two plants.

One in Chicago.

And another.

In San Francisco.

Now say the HQ or the headquarters plant needs some stationery.

Pens, papers, pencils, printer supplies, so on.

Now we don't want to mass produce stationery.

Right.

Why it's a waste of money.

Instead.

Procure them when needed.

We can afford to do this.

We can't do this for coffee.

Why?

Because coffee is such an essential commodity.

We can't open our shop without coffee, but stationery is basically low value, low priority item.

So for materials like that, irrespective of the material, there is always a cost associated with the

procure to pay cycle.

Meaning to get something to buy something, you have to identify the vendor, have a relationship with

the vendor issue POS.

You need a purchasing officer, somebody needs to receive the goods and then evaluate the goods somebody

in the office needs to take in the invoice.

Record it.

Find out how long it's due.

Pay it in time.

This is the typical procure to pay cycle, right?

Now there is a cost associated with this cycle.

It needs manpower, it needs documentation, it needs a process to be followed.

For most materials, this process is okay.

The overhead in this process is justifiable.

Why?

Because process makes sure that you get the goods in time.

Coffee is made in time.

The coffee machine is there.

Procured in time.

The pastry is procured in time.

Everything is kept ready to go.

But for some materials, for example, you want to do a birthday party in your coffee shop.

You need balloons, party hats, straws.

And for serving coffee you need coffee cups and for printing out stuff, you need stationery.

Now, these are low value non-essential items.

They're called class C items.

Where the called classy.

Because they are low value.

And non-essential.

Coffee is essential.

Party balloons are not essential, at least for this shop.

So for procuring class C items or non-essential items, you don't have to go through the entire purchasing

cycle for every batch of products.

Meaning if you need 1000 coffee cups, you don't have to put a purchase order for that.

What you can do instead is place one purchase order.

Right for let's say each coffee cup is $0.10 or $0.05.

Right.

So $0.05 per cup and.

You allocate a budget for coffee cups, let's say every day your shop consumes, let's say 1000 cups,

right?

So that's 1000 into $0.05.

That becomes $50.

Right.

So you do the math and say there are ten shops in Chicago and you end up with $500.

Were the coffee cups.

Multiply it by let's say you want to keep stock for 15 days.

15, that becomes 7500.

Dollars.

Right.

So every 15 days or two weeks you need.

To order $7,500 worth of coffee cups.

Now, suppliers did not just supply.

Coffee cups.

Right.

They could supply all the other things that we were talking about.

For example, a baking shop will supply coffee cups will supply parchment paper, will supply most of

these classy items that a bakery or coffee shop needs.

So instead of saying, Hey, you know what, I need 50 coffee cups, here is my order.

I need ten parchment papers.

Here is my order.

Instead of that, what you can do is you could say, Hey, vendor.

Vendor ABC supplier of baking goods.

Here is my order for 20,000.

All right.

And these are all classy items.

Low value items.

I'm not going to keep stock of them.

Somebody in my coffee shop or my company.

Is going to give you an order.

Just deliver it to them.

And as you deliver, keep sending me the invoice.

Let's create a blanket purchase order and see how it's different from a typical purchase order.
