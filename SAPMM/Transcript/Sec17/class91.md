So let's summarize what we've learned about consignment.

Think of a consignment.

As a lot a lot that the vendors, not just one vendor, any number of vendors can supply goods into.

And we consume goods from that lot.

The Lord is not our property.

It's the property of the vendor.

The vendor is merely making the goods available to us as a convenience factor.

So ownership is not ours.

It's with the vendor and.

The goods are being put there purely from a convenience perspective, from a goods movement perspective.

Use a 101.

Or a 201.

And in this case of receipts, use 101 and you use special movement indicator K that tells the system

to put the stock as special stock, tag it with the vendor.

If you go to look at the lot for that material, you'll see that the consignment stock is separated

out at the storage location level.

So if there is Chicago and then underneath that there is coffee.

That is baked goods storage location underneath coffee in unrestricted stock.

There is regular stock and there is consignment stock.

And if you go double click on consignment stock, it will show you a split of what 4001 gave us and

what 4002 vendor gave us.

So it remembers that this amount of goods is consignment goods.

And out of this, so much came from vendor one, so much came from Vendor two.

Easy way to track things.

Now the moment you consume goods from the lot.

Again.

Consumption can happen from a sales order.

From a project system or against a cost center.

Or an employee could need some of the goods.

Any demand document can consume these goods.

The moment you consume things, that's when you become liable.

Meaning you're bound to pay.

And because the consumption is not transparent to the vendor, he doesn't know that you have consumed

the goods.

You know it because it's happening from your lot.

Because of that, the vendor doesn't send you an invoice.

Instead you self generate.

Or settle your invoice in Moscow, not Miro.

Miro.

So.

So purely from an SAP perspective, this is all 21 N with item category K that makes it a consignment

and the vendor is going to deliver it against a lot and we receive them using my go and that my go does

not produce an accounting document.

It does not.

Okay.

So it does not produce an accounting document.

And item category is K.

Now when you consume.

So you can consume using my goal, right?

Or using sales order or any kind of document.

And when you do consume goods from the lot, this produces an accounting document like any other regular

consumption.

And when you settle the invoice, it will generate an invoice.

Hit the vendors accounts payable and our financial department will go pay for it.

This is a consignment.
