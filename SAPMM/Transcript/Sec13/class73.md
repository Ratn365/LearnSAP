In this section.

We will talk about outline agreements.

What are outline agreements?

These are short term and long term agreements with the vendor to supply goods under certain conditions.

We'll understand what those conditions are and why we need to do them.

Basically.

There are two types of outline agreements and we are going to see both those types.

But before we go into the types of outline agreements, let's understand why we need to get into an

agreement with the vendor.

So far we have been procuring coffee, flour, sugar, all different kinds of stuff.

That we need for our business.

And we have been procuring them for the Chicago plant.

This is my Chicago plant.

And if I expand my business, I could do more plants in Chicago.

Chicago.

Two.

Chicago, three.

So on.

Right.

I could establish more coffee plants in different parts of Chicago.

Or spread out into Illinois, the state.

Or I could establish a shop in San Francisco.

It depends on where my business leads me.

Now, let's say I'm still headquartered in Chicago, but I have shops in multiple places in Chicago.

And in multiple states as well.

Right.

Say I have ten shops, five shops in Chicago and five shops.

In San Francisco, now sitting in Chicago.

On procuring goods.

For Chicago.

As well as San Francisco.

Right.

And I'm doing this from the purchase.

Org US zero one.

That's the purchase org for which I maintain the prices.

I maintain vendors.

I maintain all the different data that's required for procurement.

Now this assumes that I'm doing procurement for all these different shops that I have or plants that

I have.

Assuming each shop is one plant, it need not be that.

But let's assume that for simplicity.

Right.

All the procurement is done from Chicago using purchase org.

Us zero one.

What does that mean?

That means it's one centralized purchasing area for all the shops and plants that I have.

So this mode of doing purchasing is called centralized purchasing.

Centralized.

Purchasing as opposed to what?

You could do something like this.

You could have one purchase.

Org us zero one.

To cater to the needs of all the Chicago plant purchasing and you could have us zero to.

Another purchase.

Org responsible for procuring for all the San Francisco brands.

This is called decentralized purchasing.

Centralized purchasing.

Decentralized purchasing.

Now, the next obvious question is.

What are the advantages of one over the other?

And when do we do centralized versus when do we do decentralized purchasing?

We do centralized purchasing.

When high volumes bring better prices.

Simple, right?

High volumes of business bring in better prices.

That's how Walmart works.

They procure in high volumes.

They get better margins and pass the savings over to the consumer, and the consumer gets better prices.

Right now in some industries it does not work that way.

So niche industries and very technology oriented industries might not work that way.

But overall, though, in general, for most conventional industries, centralized purchasing is always

better because you get better margins when you go with higher procurement volume.

Let me give you an example.

Say every week Chicago is procuring, say, 100 kilos or pounds of coffee every week.

Okay.

That means over the course of four weeks, it's going to procure £400.

Per month.

And multiplied by 12 equals.

4800 kilos.

But I know now if I have five plants like that, I'm going to say it's going to be roughly around.

25,000 kilos per year.

Right.

That's not a small volume.

But 4800 might not be such a big volume.

Right.

So if US zero one were to only procure for Chicago.

At best, we are going to procure a maximum of 25,000 kilos.

For ears of coffee.

Just coffee.

And this guy says San Francisco also procures 25,000 kilos per year.

Combined together, we have a volume of 50,000 per year.

So 50,000 is obviously a much bigger volume than 25,000.

But what does this volume get us now when we have bigger volumes like this?

We can negotiate.

Better.

Terms.

With the vendor.

Now, I'm not just saying price.

I'm saying better terms.

Because terms could mean better price.

Better shipping.

Better payment terms.

Any of these.

Now let's see how a typical negotiation happens and and what are the tools that the purchasing manager

has to do this negotiation.

So the purchasing manager sitting in Chicago.

Uh, calls up the vendor 4001 and says, I want to negotiate better prices.

Can we sit together?

All right.

He either comes over to our plant or we go to the vendor's place and.

Before going there, the purchasing manager prints out a sheet from SAP.

It's called as the Buyer's negotiation Sheet.

SAP by default, provides a buyer's negotiation sheet, but there could also be custom programs to print

the negotiation sheet.

The way the purchasing manager wants it.

Okay, so what is this negotiation sheet?

We go to logistics material management, purchasing under master data info record.

There is something called as a buyer's negotiation sheet.

What is a bias negotiation sheet?

So it gives a history of all the materials, their volumes, their prices purchased from a particular

vendor or by material.

Now let's look at the sheet by vendor because we have called vendor 4001 A, B, C foods for negotiation.

So click on buy vendor and say 4001 and purchase org is US zero one.

Right.

And you could specify a material or it need not, because if you want to negotiate only for a particular

material, you could do that.

And if not, you could say all materials.

Right.

And output on screen click.

Okay.

So this is a sample bias negotiation sheet.

It need not always be this way.

This is something that SAP provides out of the box.

Okay, so what does it say?

It says these are our payments for the event that we do for the vendor.

These are the total amount of POS that has been purchased.

9120 And then.

The materials that we have purchased from this vendor.

So far we have procured £710 and the total price is $6,900 and the delivery time is five days.

Um, the, the last order price is 875.

Right.

So things like this, this is a different material.

Coffee beans zero three So we didn't select a material, right?

So it's giving us a list of all the materials procured from this vendor.

At what prices they've been procured.

What is the total that we have been procuring from day one?

If we specify a date range, it will give us all the procurement happening within that date.

If not, it defaults all the way from the beginning.

So what does the sheet give us?

So if I'm the purchasing manager, I take a print out of this, go sit with the vendor and say, Hey,

you know what?

I've been procuring £700 and I've spent $7000 or $6800 on procuring coffee from you, and I'm going

to open three more shops or I have opened five more shops already and the volume is going to go up by

so much.

And the place that we are doing currently is so much.

And now my request is I want a better price.

The more volume you do, the better price you can negotiate.

Think of Walmart.

So here is me.

The purchasing manager.

And here is the vendor 4001 ABC Foods.

And I take a copy of the buyers negotiation sheet.

And which has the list of products.

And all the prizes and the total volumes.

Like, you know, I've procured £710 and the total I have spent is $7,000.

Right.

So the buyers negotiation sheet helps me, you know, have the stats, right?

When I talk to the vendor now, like I said, we are going to open more shops, right?

That means we need more volume.

So I'm going to ask the vendor.

To reduce the price because I'm going to procure, say, £50,000 of coffee in the next year or in the

next six months.

Now let's switch places and think about the vendor.

Now, what is the vendor thinking?

Now this guy is doing more volumes.

That means sustainable business for me with, uh, this company.

Coffee shop.

So what can I offer him without losing my advantage?

Right.

So vendors typically offer two types of terms.

The first type of tool that vendors have in their negotiation.

Is called as a contract.

The second kind of tool is called as a scheduling agreement.

Both are roughly similar.

Not not much different.

Just focus on contract.

What is your contract?

We have been into contracts, right?

An iPhone is expensive.

So we enter into a contract with AT&T.

And get it at a reduced price, say a monthly price of $30 or $40.

But the contract obliges you to pay the same amount for a period of 12 months or 24 months.

Right.

So you are basically, as a customer, committing to a particular volume, a volume of 24 months of

cell phone service.

And along with that, you get the product, which is the iPhone for free or for a lower price.

Similarly, when you think of this transaction from the vendor's perspective.

He would want you, the coffee shop, to enter into a contract.

And the contract will typically look something like this.

Currently, the price is, say, $10.

Per pound or kilo.

Am willing to go down on it, say by.

$9.

Provided.

You procure £50,000 per year.

Simple enough, right?

But this is typically a win win for both.

The vendor gets a consistent high volume.

And I'm not going to go to 4002, which is X, y, z false, because I committed to £50,000 per year

of purchases from this vendor.

This vendor.

ABC Foods can agree to lower the price by a dollar per pound and still he would make margins.

Another type of agreement is say, I don't just procure coffee from 4001.

I also procure dairy creamer.

I also procure cups, I procure sugar.

I procure flour.

In which case I don't have to limit this contract to just £50,000 of coffee per year.

I could say.

Do a business of, say, 500,000 per year.

Dollars per year.

And it could be anything.

It could be coffee, it could be flower, it could be sugar.

And with that volume, I'm going to give you coffee at dollar nine per pound.

Sugar at dollar.

Say the regular price is four and I'm going to give you a $3 per pound.

So on and so forth.

So these are the two major types of contracts that vendors and companies get into.

This kind of contract is called.

A quantity contract.

A quantity contract.

And this is called a value contract.

So two types of contracts.

Quantity, Contract value Contract.

So let's quickly go through what we have learned here.

Our business has been growing.

And we have started putting more plants in Chicago, meaning more shops in Chicago.

The coffee shops.

And there could be another purchasing manager sitting in the San Francisco plant and he could be procuring

for the San Francisco shops and another one in the Chicago shops.

That mode of purchasing is called decentralized purchasing.

An alternative to it is centralized purchasing where one purchaser.

Is responsible for procuring for multiple plants Chicago, San Francisco, any other cities that we

open our shops.

And what is the advantage of centralized purchasing?

Because centralized purchasing increases volumes because all shops are going to be purchasing from one

single window.

Right.

So you can negotiate better terms.

Buy better terms.

We meant better price.

Better shipping terms, better payment terms, better incoterms any of those.

Anything that is advantageous to the company.

One of the tools that the purchasing manager has.

Is called as a buyer's negotiation sheet, which is a report out of SAP that just gives you a cumulated

list of volumes and values.

How much we have been procuring from this date until this date.

Just a tool to negotiate with the vendor.

And now from a vendors perspective, because we are offering increased volumes in sales.

Vendors typically tend to go for a contract with us.

So contract.

Could mean committing to more volume or committing to more value.

When you commit to more volume, it's called quantity contract.

When you commit to more value, it's called value contract.

In the next chapter, we'll create quantity and value contracts in SAP and see how we can proceed further

with these contracts.
