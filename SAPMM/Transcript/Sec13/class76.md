So what's a scheduling agreement?

Scheduling agreement is very similar to a contract, and that's the reason why we have classified them

as outline agreements.

But what is the difference?

The difference is in a scheduling agreement, we're going to have a schedule of when the vendor is going

to deliver.

What?

That's the scheduling agreement.

So if we want coffee at, say, £100 a week, so we're going to say £100 per week.

Hundred this week.

100 next week.

100 next week.

And we are going to specify the dates.

That's a scheduling agreement.

Now, why do we need a scheduling agreement as opposed to a contract?

Now, for a coffee shop, this has very limited use.

Probable reason that I can think of is anyway, we require £100 per week.

So instead of creating purchase order every week for £100 referring to that contract, we could create

a scheduling agreement which will tell the vendor that we need £100 per week.

That's a simple use case for using scheduling agreement in our coffee shop.

But a scheduling agreement is used more in conjunction with MRP, which we have not covered, so we're

not going to talk about now.

In a manufacturing industry, say Honda has a manufacturing plant, It's an assembly line and it has

hundreds of suppliers, suppliers supplying different kinds of materials for the car or the engine.

Now the assembly line goes at a particular speed, ten cars per day or 100 cars per day.

And to produce 100 cars per day.

You require so many parts and it's fixed, right?

Each car has an engine.

Each car has four doors or five doors.

Four wheels.

Two axles.

So the components by car is fixed.

And if you fix the output, which is say, ten cars per day, you require so many parts per day and

creating a purchase order every day is very cumbersome, right?

Because it's an assembly line that continuously manufacture cars.

You know what your desired output is.

So you know what your procurement plan is.

How many you require per day or per week.

In cases like that, you could use a scheduling agreement whereby you send this agreement to the vendor

saying, deliver me these quantities at these dates, at these prices.

So apart from quantities that we dictate in contracts, in a scheduling agreement, you also dictate

the schedule.

The schedule of delivery.

That's why it's called as a scheduling agreement.

So let's go create one.

How do you do that?

Close contracts and open scheduling agreements create vendor unknown and for vendor 401 agreement type.

Is scheduling LP.

So LP is more involved.

So let's not go there.

Let's just select scheduling agreement.

Right.

And.

For us.

Zero one Company code.

Valid for one year.

Right.

And coffee beans.

Target.

What's the target For one year?

We want to procure £50,000.

Right.

And we want to procure them for the Chicago plan.

Now, when you create a scheduling agreement, it specifically asking you for the plan.

Right.

Why?

Because a schedule can only be created for a plant.

When you give a schedule, you have to also tell the vendor where you have to deliver them.

That's why it's asking you specifically for the plant.

Now, net price, $9 say right, go, click save.

So copy this scheduling agreement.

No, we said the difference between a contract and scheduling agreement is that a scheduling agreement

has a schedule of delivery.

But so far it was very similar to a contract, right?

We created a scheduling agreement.

We put the quantity in there, we put the price, we put the plant.

But we didn't specify the schedule, did we?

So where do we specify the schedule?

Go to delivery schedule and click on Maintain.

Enter your scheduling agreement number and select that line item and click on the delivery schedule.

Here.

We're going to put a date.

Now, today.

Is on Monday, 19th September 2016.

Now, let's say every Monday, seven days from now, seven days from now.

We need £100 of coffee.

Okay.

1926, three.

So on and so forth.

So 19.

We need a quantity of 100.

Right.

And on.

What's the next day?

26.

And on 26.

We need another £100, so on and so forth.

You get the picture right?

And it's saying delivery.

Can the delivery date be met?

Well, let's say it can be met.

Okay.

We'll talk about that later.

So we have created two schedule lines.

And let's assume we have created schedule lines for the entire month or entire year.

Right.

Just more lines here every week, 100, 200 or 100, whatever, quantity.

And it also shows you the accumulated quantity.

Right.

So what is the total accumulated quantity that we have ordered so far?

Save this guy.

Now the vendor knows when to deliver and how much to deliver.

So the beauty of this scheduling agreement is you don't need to create a release order.

No need to create release orders every time you need coffee.

You already told him the times that you need and the quantities that you need.

All you need to do is go to my go.

Which is good.

Proceed.

So enter your scheduling agreement.

Hit enter and see.

Automatically knows that on this day the vendor is supposed to deliver 200.

So did he deliver all the 200?

Maybe he did.

Where did he deliver it to?

To our coffee storage location.

Say item.

Okay.

And.

Click save.

And you could take it further.

Create an invoice.

Now if you go back to the scheduling agreement.

And if you look at the scheduling agreement.

Scroll a little to the right.

And then.

You should see that we have received goods for a quantity of 200.

100 plus.

100, which was supposed to be delivered today.

919.

2016.

And on 926, when the next delivery comes in, you could take a good receipt for that and the open quantity

of 100 would switch to the quantity.

Right.

So it's just a way of for SAP to track what's happening to the scheduling agreement.

Now, this is similar to the way a value contract or a quantity contract tracks how much has been released

in terms of value or in terms of quantity of that contract.

So that's a scheduling agreement.

So we have created a simple scheduling agreement of type LP.

And we are specified a schedule.

I need $100 on the first Monday.

The second Monday.

Third Monday.

Fourth Monday.

So on and so forth.

And when the time comes, just do a go.

My goal for this, and if you go back to the scheduling agreement, you can see that the status for

that line item will change from open quantity to goods received.

So that's a scheduling agreement.

So scheduling agreements and contracts are the two types of outline agreements that are used in SAP.

Both are very similar.

Contracts and scheduling agreements.

A contract specifies either a value or a volume of how much can be procured within a particular time.

A scheduling agreement also specifies the dates for deliveries so that you don't have to explicitly

create release orders on particular dates.

So contracts give you flexibility, meaning you can create the purchase orders when you require as long

as you're able to procure the total that you promised the vendor within that particular time.

Scheduling agreements do not give you that freedom, but instead gives you the freedom from having to

create release orders POS every week, for example.

So if your procurement goes like clockwork every week, £100 every week, £200, then you can use a

scheduling agreement.

If not, you can very well go with contracts.

And these are the different kinds of outline agreements.
