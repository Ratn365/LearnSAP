s course taught?

If you take a company like Starbucks.

All right.

So this is the Starbucks angel or whoever.

Starbucks has thousands of stores, right?

I don't know how many thousands, thousands of stores.

And of course it uses an ERP.

It doesn't matter.

SAP.

Oracle doesn't matter.

It uses some kind of ERP and it has a huge org structure.

So there's a CEO and then underneath that there are.

Different functions, right?

You know the drill.

What if I want to start a coffee shop?

Right.

Just one shop.

I want to start a coffee shop like this.

I'm the owner.

So no org structure, no complicated things.

How different is running this shop from running a coffee shop of Starbucks?

I have to procure coffee beans.

I have to store and manage the inventory, meaning coffee beans, creamer, milk, whatnot.

You know, any bakery items.

I got to do my h.r.

I might have five employees or ten employees.

Still.

I need to do h.r.

Right.

I need to manage their payroll.

I need to manage their promotions.

I also need to do planning.

I got to plan the inventory very much ahead of time.

Otherwise they will not be able to give them coffee.

Starbucks also needs the same thing.

They also need to procure coffee.

They need to store and manage their inventory.

They need HR, they need planning, everything that I need.

They just need it on a much, much larger scale, thousands of times over.

But the business processes very much remain the same.

So I'm going to immerse you.

In the business processes that are required to set up a coffee shop.

Of course, from a material management perspective so that you understand things.

With a much smaller scope, but covering all the business processes that way.

By the end of this course, we would have covered most of the business scenarios in SAP.
