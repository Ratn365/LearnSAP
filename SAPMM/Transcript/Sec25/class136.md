Well, there are some constraints that you have to follow.

Or that you are forced to follow when you are trying to do physical inventory counting.

One of the primary constraints, like I said, is if you are counting bag of coffee or a lot of coffee

you don't want.

To be disturbed, right?

You don't want goods, receipts or goods issues.

Happening at that point in time.

So how do you prevent any kind of activity for that material during that one hour or one day where you

are counting because it causes confusion to the person who is counting?

The way to do that is when you create a physical inventory document.

Click on the posting block.

Okay, So when you select the posting block and put in coffee beans oh one.

Right click save.

Here is our physical inventory document.

Now let's see what's the effect of putting that posting block.

Now I can go count.

No problem.

But can I do a good receipt or a good issue?

So let's do a my go and see if we can really do a good receipt.

Okay.

We don't want to do goods receipt against the purchase order.

We want to do it against another like a cost center because we don't have a purchase order.

In Plant, Chicago.

In storage, Location.

Coffee.

So for material coffee beans or one.

Right?

Say Â£100.

Put in 201.

2001 is against a cost center, right?

So we're going to put a cost center, say admin.

Okay.

That way we don't have to enter a purchase order item.

Okay.

Check if everything is okay.

So material coffee beans blocked due to physical inventory.

Okay, so the first constraint is block all goods movements.

How do you do that?

If you go to the material document, go to header.

You see that there is a posting block.

So to block all goods movement use.

Posting block.

A posting blog on the physical inventory document ensures that No.

Goods, receipts or goods issues can happen once the physical inventory starts.

Now there is a second constraint.

We have created a physical inventory document for coffee beans.

Oh one Right.

Now let's do another physical inventory document for the same material.

Coffee Beans.

Oh one.

Physical inventory document already active.

That means there can be only one physical inventory document.

Active.

Of course, for material, you can create other physical inventory documents for other materials.

But for this material, coffee beans or one.

There can only be one physical inventory document.

The reason being, once you start counting, you don't want somebody else to start counting again.

Until the person who has started the count has finished the count.

This ensures that there is no confusion.

Right.

That's the second constraint.
