How to get access to an IDES system
Getting Access to an IDES system can be a bit difficult for starters.

Background - SAP is a proprietary ERP system that requires license to operate - even in a non productive environment. For example, to install and run an IDES system you would have to be either a licensed customer or a service provider. Unfortunately, neither me nor udemy can provide access to an SAP system due to the constraints mentioned above.

What do do  - Like I always keep saying, having access to an IDES system is very important to be able to learn anything in SAP. Luckily, there are some options -

Option 1 - Go straight to the root - SAP. You can visit it here to get SAP Access for a fixed number of hours and the charges are based on which country you are trying to access it from. I am not from SAP and this is just a recommendation.

Option 2 - Apart from SAP, there are some other providers that do provide SAP Access for a monthly fee. Which of these are legitimate and which of them are not is something you would have to decipher for yourself. I would leave it to the discretion of the reader to pick the correct provider. Nevertheless, all of them work pretty well from a practical standpoint. Just do a google search for "SAP Access" and pick a provider that matches your budget.
