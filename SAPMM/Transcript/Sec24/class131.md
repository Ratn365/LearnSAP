Go to one.

And that's where we start all the time, right?

So put in coffee beans.

Zero five.

The quantity of 100.

Okay, This is a new material, so you have to enter a price.

So let's say put $11.

And because the system knows this material is split valuated, you can enter a valuation type here.

This is procurement from Brazil.

You can specify that here or you don't need to.

You could do it at the goods receipt level.

If the vendor is sending us Indian origin coffee, you could change it there.

Right.

But if you want to specify it here, you can specify it here as well.

This is optional, though.

Okay.

So go ahead.

Save it.

And here is our.

Control C.

Now go do a my go.

Against a purchase order, of course.

Ctrl V and Storage Location.

Coffee Beans.

Item.

Okay.

But what is the type of material?

The material that we are entering is of Brazilian origin.

Okay.

Check if everything is okay and save.

So we have procured Brazilian coffee £100 at $11 per pound.

Now let's also procure Indian coffee at $13 per pound and then we can see how the material is evaluated.

So go back to purchase order.

N.

21 n.

Everything would remain the same.

4001.

Vendor Coffee Beans.

Oh five.

Same hundred pounds.

Okay, the price is $11, but we can change the price now to $13.

All right, Save it.

So there is RPO, Ctrl C.

Go to my go put the purchase order number in there

and what's the valuation type?

What's our country of origin here?

It's India.

Right.

And then where are we procuring it?

Into our coffee bean storage location.

With the item.

Okay.

Click check to see everything is okay.

And save it.

All right.

So what have we done here?

We have procured £100 of Indian origin coffee at $13 per pound, and we have procured £100 of Brazilian

coffee at $11 per pound.

And what do we expect to see?

We expect to see that the material is evaluated separately.

Because all of them have been procured into the Chicago plant.

Coffee, beans, storage location.

If we did not have split valuation, SAP would have averaged out the $11 and $13 and said that the average

price is, say, $12.

It doesn't tell you that we have procured 100 leaves at $11.

100 leaves at $13.

And this is how the stock is different.

It averages out everything if it were just moving average.

Now it's moving average plus split valuation.

We are trying to evaluate the material at the same plant storage location using different characteristics.

In this case, we are using country of origin.

So go to zero three.

Select coffee beans.

And we want to see valuation.

Right?

Go to accounting view.

Select Chicago one and what's the valuation type?

We want, let's say India.

All right.

You see that?

£100 at $13 per pound.

That comes to $1,300.

Right.

So SAP is evaluating the material using the valuation type India, which is the country of origin and

maintaining a separate price.

It also maintains separate stock.

See, that's so simple, right?

Now, this is not the only advantage.

Let's go to.

Select coffee beans and select the plant.

Chicago one.

Click execute.

Okay.

And you see that it gives you the valuation and quantity.

We have seen the valuation previously in the Material Master.

Now, it also separates the quantity based on these characteristics.

I have £100 of Brazilian coffee and I have £100 of Indian coffee.

Cool.

Right.

Because we were able to tag the material at the time of goods receipt and to tag it, we had to do a

little bit of configuration.

Finally, the end result is that we are able to track the same material using these three different

characteristics.
