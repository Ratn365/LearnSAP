So let's summarize what we have learned here.

So we have learned a little bit about valuation in the previous course.

And in this section we have learned a little bit of how quantity and value is updated using the material

type and plant.

Now, we talked about split valuation.

What is split valuation?

When you want to maintain stock, when I mean stock, the amount of stock.

And.

Value of stock separately based on different characteristics.

So maintaining stock and values when mean stock, the quantity value is quantity multiplied by unit

price.

Based on different characteristics.

In this case, we have taken country of origin.

We said Indian origin coffee.

I have £100, Brazilian origin coffee.

I have £200.

Indian origin coffee price is so much the Brazilian origin.

Coffee price is so much.

If you want to maintain valuation based on a different set of criteria for the same plant and source

location, then you use split valuation.

Examples are country of origin.

Now, let me give you another example.

For coffee beans, which is raw material that is procured.

You could tag it with different characteristics.

Split valuation is probably used most when you want to separate the cost of in-house production versus

external purchase.

If you take the example of Muffin.

Say, this is our muffin and you either manufacture it or you procure it.

When you manufacture it and do a goods receipt, it's going to cost so much.

And when you procure it, it's going to cost so much.

It's the same material.

Muffin.

Same muffin.

Zero one.

But when you manufacture it, its price is different.

When you procure it, its price is different.

You want to maintain data like this.

Okay.

Form of zero one.

I have internally manufactured muffins 120 in quantity and 50 externally procured.

And the value.

Let's say each muffin is a dollar for manufacturing.

So $120.

And procured.

Muffins are $1.50.

So this is.

$75.

So you can maintain quantity and value based on these characteristics.
