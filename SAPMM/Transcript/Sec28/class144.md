So far.

We have talked about coffee beans, which are procured externally.

What about materials that we manufacture internally?

Example, muffins, cakes, pastries that our bakery produces.

How do you run for that based on reorder point based planning?

Same process, nothing different, just that the material is being created slightly differently.

So we are talking about manual.

Reorder point based.

Planning.

For.

Materials produced in house.

This is in contrast to materials like coffee beans.

Which are procured, for example.

Muffins.

These are produced internally in our factory or the bakery.

So where do we start?

We start with the material.

So go to zero one.

And let's try and create Muffin, say 11.

So coffee Beans 11 was used for testing manual reorder, point based planning.

And that was for external procurement.

And this is a case of internal manufacturing.

So this is going to be finished goods, right?

It's not raw material.

Because this is something that we sell directly.

So go ahead.

Select basic view.

Don't need the sales view.

Don't need the purchase view.

You can select these two views and.

And do accounting.

All right, so let's.

Chicago one storage location.

Coffee.

Just put some description, put some base unit as usual, some material group enter.

And type is web, right?

Manual reorder point based planning.

And the reorder point is, let's say 500 count.

And the MRP controller.

001.

The lot.

Size X.

The procurement.

Is in house.

So I'm going to change this to in house E.

All right.

So when we procure anything internally or when we produce something internally, we should specify how

long it takes to produce them.

So let's say it takes five days.

So five days to produce them.

And the valuation class is, let's say 7920 and the price of muffin is $1.

Well, the cost of Muffin.

And before I go, let me change the unit of measure to each.

Because we are not going to sell muffins by the pounds or kilos.

Right?

We're going to sell one muffin each.

So one muffin each and.

Manual reorder point is 500.

All right, Save it.

So we just created the material.

So if you go to IMDb, there will not be any star.

Now go to zero three and let's run for muffin 11.

Of course, in Plant Chicago one.

All right, let's run it.

Hit.

Enter.

So MRP is done.

Now let's go to zero four and look at what are the entries that has created.

All right.

Do you see that it did not create a purchase requisition.

It created a planned order pl ord that stands for planned order and that's for 500, which is expected

because the minimum reorder point is 500.

Now.

What is a planned order?

And why did create a planned order as opposed to a purchase requisition?

Well, you must have guessed it, right, because this material is not externally procured.

It has created a planned order, or rather, it did not create a purchase requisition.

So what is a plant order?

A planned order is a precursor to either a purchase requisition or a production order, but more importantly,

production order.

Let me draw it for you.

And before I go and draw, what I've done here is I've created the material.

Muffins.

Right?

Material Muffin.

Levon.

So this is the material that I have created.

And what did I do?

I set the procurement.

Type two E.

E stands for in-house production and production days, and the number of days is five days.

Production time is five days and the lot size.

Is.

And MRP type.

Is VB Manual reorder point based planning.

And of course.

The reorder point has been set to 500.

Now, as usual, we have run MD zero three run, which is that robot that goes and does all this intelligent

logic and.

It makes some entries in MD zero four or the stock requirement list.

But when we went to Md0 for.

What did it do?

It created planned order, of course, for a quantity of 500.

Now, what is a planned order?

Typically a material, any material.

Can be procured externally.

Externally.

Or produced in-house.

Or sometimes it can be both.

For finished materials.

Typically it can be both.

You can either produce those goods internally or if things don't permit, maybe something broke down

in your plan.

You can procure them externally.

And this is set in the.

To view of the material where you say E.

Is in house.

If.

Is external production and X in case you want to do both.

Coffee beans was an example of material.

That was procured externally.

We have seen an example of that.

And.

Muffins.

Is an example of a material produced in-house.

And this is the example that we have just seen.

Now in terms of mrcp.

We have said both these materials as manual reorder, point based planning VB and set the minimum reorder

point to 500.

In case of external procurement MRP generated.

A purchase requisition.

Now, in this case, MRP generated a planned order.

And I said planned order is a precursor to either purchase requisition or a production order, and that

that must be confusing.

I'll explain.
