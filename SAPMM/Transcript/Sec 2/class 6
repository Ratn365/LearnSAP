Now we are going to talk about the purchasing life cycle.

I'm going to open this coffee shop and right next to it, I'm going to have.

A factory.

I use this.

To make and store goods.

I need this to run my coffee shop.

I need some simple stuff like coffee beans, flour, sugar and stuff like that.

What I'm going to do is I'm going to find a vendor who can deliver this stuff for me.

So I'm going to go to Google, find out who the nearest vendor is.

Say, call him.

ABC goods.

What ABC Foods.

And I'm going to call him over the phone and say, I need flour.

£300.

I need sugar.

See £50.

And I need coffee beans.

See £20 to start with.

So this vendor is going to take some time to deliver the goods.

Say in five days he's going to deliver the goods.

He's going to deliver flour, sugar and coffee beans.

In the respective quantities and somebody in the stores is going to receive them.

And store it somewhere in the location.

A couple of days later.

He sends us a request.

That request is for payment.

It's going to say, okay, Bill number.

23205.

Just some number and it's going to say flour.

£100.

And say £1 costs $1.

So that's dollar 100 and sugar is £50.

And £1 costs, say, $2.

So that's $100.

And coffee beans.

Is £20 and each pound say costs $4.

It's going to be 80.

So this is a the rate of $1 per pound.

This is the rate of $2 per pound.

And this is at the rate of.

For dollar per pound.

Right.

And the total here is going to be 280 and say there is a tax of 10% sales tax.

That's going to be 28.

And the total is going to be $308.

That's what we should be paying this vendor.

Again, this comes as a paper invoice or an email.

And it comes to my address, and that's the request for payment.

So I have some time to clear this invoice as soon as it's sent.

Say, this is sent on Jan fifth.

This was sent on January 1st.

This came in on January 5th.

And say this came on January 6th.

Now.

I have some time to pay this invoice.

I don't need to pay it immediately.

So I have some time.

I take my time.

And maybe.

On Jan, say 25th.

I pay this invoice.

So what we are doing is basically sending a check or cash for dollar 308.

So let's see what's happening here.

So there are four steps that happened here.

First step is called.

This step here is called purchase order.

The second step is called goods receipt.

Because you are receiving the goods into the warehouse.

The third step is called invoice receipt.

You receive the goods.

And now you receive the invoice.

The final step is payment.

Step number.

One, two, three.

And for.

This is the basic life cycle.

Of a purchase order.

There is a purchase order that goes out to the vendor.

The vendor sends the goods.

The vendor also sends the invoice and we pay the vendor.
