 

If you want to see it, it's not under the logistics section, so it's under accounting.

So it's not under logistics, but under accounting.

So under accounting go to account payable because it's something we are paying out to the vendor and

go to document entry, outgoing payment and the transaction code is F dash 53.

Now.

Do you have a reference to the PO or invoice to pay the vendor?

So when you go to f 53, if you go back.

The number that you have here is reference.

It's neither the number nor the goods receipt number or the invoice receipt number.

Neither of these.

It's the accounting document number that the invoices created.

Do you have a reference?

No.

The natural answer to the next question is, is the vendor payment accounting document recorded?

No.

If you want to check it, you can always go and go to m e 23 n, which is the transaction to create

or view the purchase order.

And you see the material document which has been created when we did the goods receipt and this is the

invoice receipt and you don't have the payment document number here because it's not related to this

purchase order.

So a payment transaction is typically separate from the logistics.
