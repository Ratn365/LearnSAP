So in this section we're going to talk about the purchase order cycle in SAP.

We're going to divide this section into three parts.

The first part is going to be purchase order.

The second part is going to be receiving the goods.

And the third part is going to be receiving the invoice.

And along the way, since we are going to look at the guy for the first time.

We'll take a couple of detours and understand the different aspects of the SAP GUI.

Let's get started.

So first part, create a purchase order.

How do you create a purchase order?

In order to do a transaction in SAP.

SAP GUI provides us a huge menu path.

This is called the menu.

And it's hierarchical, for example.

This section deals with logistics, and under logistics you'll have materials management, sales and

distribution, warehouse management, so on and so forth.

And then there will be a section for finance, there will be a section for office related tasks.

So it's a hierarchical menu.

If you take M or material management, it's under logistics.

And under material management, you'll have a ton of other hierarchical structures like purchasing inventory

management, so on and so forth.

Let me show that to you.

So this is what I was talking about.

You have logistics.

And underneath that you have material management, sales and distribution production, plant maintenance.

So on.

Under material management, you have purchasing inventory management, invoice verification, physical

inventory valuation, so on and so forth.

To create a purchase order.

The menu would be under purchasing.

Purchase order and then create.

Click on vendor supplying plant noon.

Just double click it.

This is how you see it when you click on the transaction for the first time.

You don't need this.

This is all for information.

Just close this.

Most of the screen looks like a blank screen right now.

But don't worry, we're going to fill it up.
