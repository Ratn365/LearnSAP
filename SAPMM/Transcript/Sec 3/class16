 part of this section, in the first part of this section, we have seen how to create

a purchase order.

In the second part, we're going to see how what happens in the second part of this video.

In this part of the video, we're going to see how.

In this part of the video.

We're going to see what happens after that.

The vendor receives the PO and the vendor says, okay, I'm going to send it now.

Maybe he'll take some time, five days, ten days, depending on how long it takes to procure those

materials, Say in ten days he sends us the 100 kilos of flour.

Right.

So he's going to load them up in a truck and then send them over to our plant because we've asked them

to supply it to our plant because that's where we need the flour.

Now, along with the truck and the goods.

Comes the packing slip.

What is a packing slip?

You have seen this when you receive an order from Amazon.

Right.

So when you receive an order from Amazon in the large brown box, there comes a slip.

A piece of paper that says this is the quantity, this is the material, this is where it's coming from

and this is where it's going to.

Right.

So it's going to my coffee shop.

Right.

And this is the address of my plant.

My telephone number and my.

Customer.

This is how the vendor refers to me.

25 for one two.

And when was the order placed, say, on 1st January 2016.

What is the order number?

This is his order number.

The vendors order number.

And this is.

My this is my purchase order number, right?

So this is where the cross reference is important.

I call it potato.

He calls it potato.

Does it matter?

It's the same thing.

We have different copies in each of our systems.

Uh, the purchase order.

I create a purchase order in my system number as 45000 and the same order when he receives it.

He's got his own ERP.

He enters it as a sales order in his system.

So and it's got a unique number.

The vendor uses that to refer to that purchase order or sales order.

And I use this number to refer to the to refer to my purchase order.

And don't worry if you don't understand it, you know it's not important.

Not unless you understand the sales processes.

You understand?

What's a sales order number?

That's fine.

We are talking about purchase order numbers here.

And then we have.

Our flower.

What quantity?

Right.

And how much has been shipped.

Now, let's go ahead and say the truck has come in and we have now receive the goods into our warehouse.

Right.

How do you do that?

Right in the purchase order hierarchy create.

We have different sections, right?

Create, release, blah blah blah.

And then we have something called follow on functions.

And under that we have goods receipt.

And under that we have goods receipt.

So let's go to a goods receipt.

Do you want to save it?

No.

So under follow on functions.

We are under follow on functions.

We have goods receipt.

Click on that.

Right here.

You can enter your purchase order.

What is this transaction?

What is this transaction?

How do you know what this transaction is?

If you click on this little button here or this if you click on these little set of arrows here.

And click on this button.

You will see a transaction here.

It's called Migo Migo.

So that's the name of the transaction, Migo.

Migo It's a technical name.

And the actual transaction is goods receipt for a purchase order.

The transaction is, Migo.

That's how you can find out what is a transaction code for any transaction that you're doing.

Some some of them might not have a transaction code, but most end user transactions do have a transaction

code.

If you want to see them in the menu path.

Because, for example, if you look at this screen, you don't see my go here against goods receipt.

But if you look at my screen.

For example, let's go back if you see my go.

Right.

How do you enable that?

You go to extras.

Settings and then ensure that you have the display technical names checked on.

Right.

If you don't have that, you won't see this.

My go here.

If you have that.

Click.

Okay.

You'll have my.

You'll have all the technical details there like.

Like so.

Okay.

Follow on functions might go.

So that's how you enable transaction codes.

All right.

Now we want to receive the goods that the vendor has sent.

We want to receive the goods that the vendor has sent into our warehouse.

Now the vendor has taken ten days to send us the goods, right?

In the meantime, you'd have created so many different purchase orders, either to the same vendor or

to different vendors.

So how do you pull back the number that the vendor has sent?

You could take that packing slip, Right?

There was a packing slip, remember?

This parking slip.

This parking slip contains the.

You could use that.

Just type it in and then pull your po.

Or you can use search to pull in the PO based on dates or based on who created it.

So these are all the search criteria that you have.

You can search by company, you can search by purchase, or you can search by purchase document, so

on and so forth.

Right.

You can also search by vendor, for example, if you want to look at all the purchase orders created

for that vendor, you could do that.

Let's see how good.

So click on this button, right?

We're going to search for purchase orders.

Click on that button.

And then instead of this tab, go to the vendor tab.

Where is it?

Purchase documents by vendor.

Right.

And then put your vendor 1 to 2 to.

And click okay.

So these are the purchase orders created for this vendor.

And I'm looking at the one that is created on 2016.

Just select it.

Click okay.

And then, as usual, hit enter.

The system is going to pull the purchase order details here.

Right.

You can go to the material and you know that the material is flour and the quantity is 100.

And where did we ask them to be delivered?

Chicago plant, so on and so forth.

The system is already pulled.

All the details for that purchase order.

Right.

So the materials quantities are automatically pulled from the purchase order into the screen.

Remember, the purchase order was a different transaction.

This is a different transaction.

So into this transaction, SAP has pulled all the details from the purchase order.

Right?

If you think everything is okay, you can do a visual inspection.

And if you think everything is okay, just say item.

Okay?

That means you're giving it a thumbs up.

And let's do it in the system.

So click item.

Okay.

Right.

Hit enter.

And click post or save.

You can do a check as well to see if there are any errors.

And if the system foresees errors, it shows you what the errors could be.

In this case, this is a standard error that you might get when you're working on a training system

in system.

Right posting only possible in periods 2006.

2011.

What is this error?

Almost you're going to see this error almost all the time in a training system.

But when you do it in a productive system, you would not have it.

So what does this really mean?

Accounting, especially material accounting.

Again, don't don't worry too much about it.

What it says is what it says is.

The accounting periods are still only open for 2006.

Period 11, which is November and December, but we are now in 2016.

2016.

So the system is ten years behind because it's a trading system.

Nobody has updated it.

So it's typically it's the duty of the finance consultant to update it.

And how do you update it?

You go to a transaction.

So we're going to close this here.

And we're going to do a transaction called MMP.

You want to save it?

No.

To go to a transaction called m m PB Okay, click okay and then put your company code 3000.

Then here.

Put in a 12.

2006 because that's the period that we have to open because 11 I believe ten and 11 have been closed.

Right.

So try this.

It says it's not the current year, 2006, which is fine.

Hit enter.

And it says the current year is 12.

2006.

So we got to open zero one 2007.

So.

Again.

Okay.

So we are entering the next open period.

Okay, so period closing is complete log issued.

So this is the message that you see when SAP has successfully closed a period.

To understand this a little bit, let me give you a little bit of information here.

So we are in 2016, right?

So in 2016 has by convention has 12 periods, Jan, Feb, so on until December, right.

So each period is labeled as 010203 all the way until 12.

At any given point in time.

Only two periods of material management or material accounts are open.

For example, where?

In April.

Which means zero four and zero three.

The previous period should be open by default.

You cannot have more than two periods open.

But because this is a training system, the system was stuck almost in 2006.

Right.

That was the last transaction anybody has done.

Maybe right now we have got to close each of these periods and then move on to 2007.

Close each of these periods and then move on to 2008.

Close each of them and then move on to 2009.

On to 2016.

So you've got to close.

Ten years worth of periods to come to the current period.

This is not a problem in a productive system because it will always be.

Up-To-Date Because this is a training system.

This is something that you have to do to really come up to speed.

It doesn't doesn't take long, really.

It takes looks very it looks very time consuming.

But each year doesn't take more than like, you know, two minutes.

Okay, let's do it on the system real fast.

So another error that you might get when you're executing this transaction is you have to enter a storage

location.

What is a storage location?

A plant is where you manufacture goods.

Well, that's the traditional definition of a plant anyway.

A storage location.

Is a place where you store the goods.

Now, why do we need to have so many different storage locations?

For example, if I'm a coffee shop, I store flour, sugar and all the different kinds of raw materials.

I store coffee beans, maybe separately, because I need to preserve the flavor.

So it needs to go into a certain location and I might store baked goods separately.

The point being, a storage location is a place or a conceptual location where we store goods.

And one plant could be associated with multiple storage locations for all practical purposes.

Think of a storage location as a warehouse.

So this plant in Chicago, for example, could be associated with 2 or 3 different storage locations,

or it could be just one.

And your storage location need not be always based on materials.

It could be based on physical location.

For example, if my plant is in Chicago, my storage location for coffee could be in Schaumburg and

for something else based on convenience.

It could be in Naperville or in Lincoln Park or any of the suburbs because real estate is cheaper there.

Just like the way we have given a plant a number.

Each storage location will be given a number too.

It could be a number or it could be alphanumeric, or it could be simply alphabetic like bxg1 for baked

goods or Naperville one for Naperville.

So you flag the item as okay.

And try to do a check again.

To get this error.

So where do you fill the storage location?

You go to storage location and you can either go to the dropdown.

And select a storage location.

Or you could just enter the storage location manually like 0001 if you know the storage location.

So that's how you fix the storage location issue.

Another error that you might have is also related to posting periods.

This time it's not the material posting, it's the finance posting.

Again, if you are starting for the first time, don't worry, it's not very important.

But just know how to fix this.

In order to fix this problem, you have to go to the transaction.

OB 52.

It's a finance transaction.

Select your company code.

When I talk about company code, it's the data that you entered in the purchase or data tab.

And then for the ending year, make sure you end it in the current year.

So this is 2016.

So enter 2016 here.

It's really simple.

I'll just show it how.

To open another tab.

Go to B 52.

Scroll down to 3000.

And for all these rows, I've already made the correction.

But you see, it was 2008 before.

Now I've corrected that to 2016.

So now you would not get that error.

But if you get that error, this is how you fix it.

So you go change it and save it.

Now you're all good to go.

Just save the document.

And here you have the material document 52503.

So this is the material document that's posted.
