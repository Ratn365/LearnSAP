 
pic is a plant.

Plant is also an enterprise structure.

The top level of enterprise structure is the company code.

And right next underneath it is the plant.

So we have a coffee company in Chicago and we have a plant, say, 1000 South Michigan Avenue, blah,

blah, blah.

And this is the plant.

Where we manufacture our pastry.

Where we store our goods, so on and so forth.

Now, how do you create a plant?

Under enterprise structure.

Instead of going to financial accounting, go to logistics, General.

And again, same thing.

Don't try to create one.

Instead copy from an existing plant.

So click on define copy, delete check plant and then click on copy delete Check plant.

And in this pop up.

Select a source.

This could be any plant under, you know, your regular company.

Code.

3000, 3000, 100, 3000, 200.

Any of those.

And then I want to create the plant as key one just to show that it's a plant in Chicago.

So let's do it in SAP.

So company code is done.

I'm going to close that.

Go to logistics, General.

Click on define copy.

Delete Check Plant.

Click on copy, delete, check and click Choose.

Or you can just double click this.

And as usual, you click on the second button.

The copy button.

And again, if you look at the left bottom corner, SAP is reading a whole bunch of tables to get you

the template of a plant.

So what's the source here?

The source I said is 3100.

Or if you want to choose another plant, you can do it.

But like I said, in a real project, you're going to choose a plant of 0001 and the to plant is Chicago

1CHI1.

Remember, this is alphanumeric.

So you can have 0001 or something like that.

But since they are already taken.

So if you go there and click on the pop up.

And click okay.

So there are so many different plans already created.

So 001 is taken, 005 is taken.

So anything that's not taken, you can use it.

So I'm going to close this and.

Say car one for a Chicago plant and click okay.

And as usual, you're going to get a bunch of messages.

Ignore them.

And we're going to create a new request for this.

At this point, what SAP is saying is you can choose to tag the change that you've just done to this.

Request.

Or you can create your own.

Now, if you want to keep things clean, you could have separate customizing requests for each logical

set of operation.

So if you are trying to create a company code, have one transport request for that.

And if you want to create a new plant, say create new plant CSR one and click save.

You don't need to do it.

You could tag this change along with the previous transport request.

But anyway, since we are doing it for the first time, try and practice to create new transport requests

and click okay.

So it says plant three 100 copied to key one without number ranges.

That's fine.

Let's click okay.

And you're done.
