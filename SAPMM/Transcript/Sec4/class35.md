 

Control C.

Go back and do a goods receipt against it.

How do you do?

Goods receipt.

Follow on functions.

My go.

Put the number in there.

Hit.

Enter.

And where do you need to store it?

You need to store it.

In raw materials because.

Flour is a raw material.

Hit.

Enter.

Click item.

Okay.

And then click on Check.

See if everything is okay.

Okay.

Document seems okay.

Click on Save.

There we have an error for object, blah blah blah.

Number Range 50 does not exist.

So what do we do?

Open another window.

Go to transaction fb N1.

Select the company code US zero one and then click on intervals.

Then say interval and then go to insert interval and say 50 for year 2016.

Enter a number.

And click on Save.

Let's go back and try and save this receipt.

The reason why we are doing these transactions again after doing the new enterprise structure is to

ensure that we iron out all these little problems.

Number ranges, posting periods, that kind of stuff.

So once we have our own set of enterprise structure materials customers, then we can easily do these

transactions without bothering too much about the kinks.

All right.

So our goods receipt is posted.

Let's also post an invoice receipt.

Go to my.

Put the purchase order in.

The invoice date is today because that's when we have received it.

And then it says, in company code zero one, the number range 51 is missing.

So in company code US zero one, the number range 51 is missing for the year 2016.

Again, how do you fix that?

Go here and then.

Give it a number range.

So interval.

51.

2016.

Instead of five one.

Just type in five two.

So put in a five to number range.

So number ranges have got to be exclusive.

So click okay and then save again.

Go back and try to execute this transaction.

Okay.

What's the amount for?

It's 400.

So enter an amount of 400.

The balance is zero.

Now try and post it.

Our invoice is posted.

So what have we done here?

We have started with clearing out some of the errors, like fixing the jurisdiction code problem, setting

an input tax percentage of zero.

And we have created a vendor 4001 and copied it with reference to 1 to 2 to.

And we've also tried to create our own material.

We cannot use 401 because it was not created in the new set of enterprise structure elements.

So go to material, master material and create.

Given material, name, flower and select a material type of raw material.

Select basic view purchasing view and accounting view.

And then go create a PO with the vendor.

4001 for material Flower zero one.

And while doing this year, we had some issues, we had issues with number ranges.

So we went to FB and won and then created number ranges for 50 and 51.

And after that we were able to do a goods receipt and invoice receipt.

Let's check the stock and see if we really got the stock.

Now let's see if we really got stock for Flower.

So go back and go to m m b e and put in flower for Chicago plant and click execute.

It should show you the stock that we've just received.

There you go.

For Chicago plant under the raw material storage location, we got a quantity of 100.

So that just confirms that we really did receive the stock.
