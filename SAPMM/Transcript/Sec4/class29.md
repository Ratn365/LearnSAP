 
ouple of months into my business.

I've repeatedly observed that most of my customers were complaining about the quality of the coffee.

Now what do I do?

So I hire somebody who's a who's who's a specialist in coffee procurement.

Say, Bob.

And I'm going to create.

A purchasing group.

Which would include Bob and anybody else working for him and call it a purchasing group for coffee.

So anytime I want to procure coffee, I'm going to use that purchasing group.

You could call it any name us one, coffee, anything you want.

It will have a number and an email and that's what the vendors are going to use anytime they have a

question.

So if they want to communicate to us about the order that we have placed, this is the number that they're

going to reach out to.

Think of it like.

The vendors contact at our location.

And how do you create a purchasing group?

Although you enter it in the org date of the purchase order, it's not really an enterprise structure

element.

So go to material management purchasing in Sbarro and you can create a purchasing group there.

Let's go create one.

So go back.

Go to Sparrow.

IMG.

Materials management.

Purchasing.

And create purchasing groups.

Go to new entries, type in US one and say us.

Coffee.

For us coffee purchasing group and then you can give them a number 312000.

And then a fax number, telephone, whatnot.

Save it.

It doesn't matter.

You don't have to really create a new transport every time because you'll be creating so many of them.

Just include it in the previous transport.

So going forward, anytime we create a purchase order for coffee, start using this purchase group.

Use zero one.

Right.

This one is this exercise is really small.

So create a new purchase group for all raw materials related to baked goods.

Call it us two.

US two for baked goods.

Now, it's not necessary that you have to create these purchasing groups based on the type of material.

The same Bob could be responsible for purchasing coffee, baked goods or any of the raw materials.

Or he could specialize.

So that depends on the nature of the business.

So Starbucks could have, you know, 100 different procurement specialists.

Walmart could have a thousand.

So depending on the nature of the business, you go out and create your purchasing groups.

So second question, is the purchasing group an enterprise structure element?

No, it's not.

Why?

Because you don't really create it under enterprise structure in Sbarro.

It's created down under material management purchasing.
