 
so in this video we're going to talk about enterprise structure, what is enterprise structure?

The enterprise structure represents the physical structure of the company.

But the first thing we need to do is create the company.

So as soon as I open my cafe, I'll call my accountant, give him the name of

my company, I will give him my address and ask him to register it with the government as a company.

Let's say a Chicago accountant registers my company as Seeb coffee company, Inc., disastrous blah, blah,

blah.

Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.

And from now on, all accounting must be done under the name Siwa Coffee Company, Inc. The reason we do this is because the government

can get his tax.

What we are trying to do here is establish the structure of the company.

So outside of SFP in common parlance.

This is called a company or legal entity, sometimes called a legal entity,

NAACP.

It's called the company.

So a company called NAACP is a legal entity outside of SJP, so a company called Mississippi is equivalent

of a legal entity.

In the real world, so let's create the company can be good tools, IMG and click on SPRO.

What is this transaction?

I hope.

This is probably the most used transaction for an ACP functional consultant.

So all the time we are performing operations like creating a purchase order, receiving goods, receiving

on invoices, etc., etc.

These are all examples of end-user transactions, but SPRO is where we get under the hood of ACP and start customizing

the way SFP works.

Okay.

So let's go to SFP and go to Tool's customising ACMG and espero.

You can go here all the time or just use a transaction called Espero and then click on

AMG ACP Reference IMG and that's all under the hood.

So all kinds of customization is done here.

So what are we trying to do?

We are trying to create a company code, and creating a company code is part of the structure of the enterprise.

That's why you turn to the structure of the enterprise.

Where is the infrastructure here?

Select that and open the menu, and under it there are basically two things - definition and assignment.

Since we are trying to determine the company named, not doing any assignment here.

Open the definition menu.

And then the company that is called is a financial transaction, so it will not be in sales management or materials management,

and it will be in financial accounting.

And below that, don't contact the phone company.

Instead, go to the Edit, Copy, Delete, Check Company menu.

The reason is that we will not define or create our own company named by you, i.e. we will not

we make it from scratch.

We will copy it from an existing company code.

Okay.

After clicking on this, this pop-up will appear, click copy, delete the company code and click select.

You can select or simply double-click on it.

And you get this screen, it's a blank screen at the top of the menu, click the second button, the one that

It looks like two sheets of paper.

This is a standard icon whenever you want to copy something from something else.

So click on this button.

And if you look in the lower left corner, you'll see that the system is recording a lot of things for you.

The system is trying to read many tables.

What it's trying to do is create a template.

And the template for a company called Three Thousand contains a lot of data, so the template that will

we are copying is a company called Three Thousand.

Remember, we already used it to create purchase orders or gross receipts.

And we're going to use three thousand because we've made some adjustments to it, like opening periods.

for material accounting, which should be 50, let's set some number of ranges and a bunch of other things.

But in a real project you will use a company called zero zero zero one.

It won't even contain three thousand, two thousand or a thousand company codes.

But because this is a media system, a test system, there will be a ton of data in it.

I chose 3000 because 3000 represents a US company, so it will have all the US related Gmail accounts already pre-populated.

configured.

So, Selecta from a company called Three Thousand, and what do you want to copy?

We're trying to start a coffee shop and start a company in the US, so I'll call it

US zero 01.

You can call it zero one zero two zero zero.

Ah, ABCDE, as you like.

Click OK and this pop-up window will appear: Do you want to copy Gyul's accounts?

You say "yes".

Do you want to allocate another local currency, know that from this point on you will see several pop-ups

windows, just ignore them.

Okay, and this window is called as a customization request.

So everything you do under the hood needs to have a unique ID so that the system knows or someone else can

knows who made this change.

And what exactly is the change?

And the way SFP records your change in the system is where a customization request is submitted.

Essentially, this is a request to customize the system.

This is a unique number.

The system generates against your part of the personalization in this case, we created a new company called

The system will generate a unique number and assign this personalization behind the scenes to this

unique number.

Click the "New" button.

And in this window, give a description.

So, what did we do?

We started a company called us zero one, so just write that the reason we're doing it is,

that someone downstream wants to know what happened and who created this company called you got it.

The system considers this as a description and generates a unique number.

OK, again, for any warnings or messages received, click OK.

And finally you should get this message company code three thousand completed to us zero one.

So, we took the company's code template for three thousand and copied it into our own template,

you as zero one.

So, what did we do here?

I went to SPRO, the transaction that is used in SFP, to customize.

And then go into the enterprise structure, definition, financial accounting and edit, copy, delete,

check the company code and then click the copy button and we discussed why we want to copy.

Correct.

And then we chose the source as three thousand and the target as you as zero one, like I said, if you do

in a real project, you would copy from zero zero zero one instead of three thousand.

Then you receive several messages.

Click Yes to copy the geolocation data and No to assign a new currency.

Okay, don't worry too much about these options because, as I said, this is an activity that your financial advisor

does it for you.

But since we don't have anyone here to help us, we also work with a company called Creation.

And then we created a transport request and assigned that transport request to that change.

And this change is assigned a unique transport request number and description.

The reason we do it is so that everyone in the chain can track who created it, at what time, and what

This is exactly the change.
