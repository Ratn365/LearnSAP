 
All right, let's solve these questions.

A company registered with the government is set up as a company called plans can be assigned to more

than one storage location.

Yes.

So you have a Chicago plant?

That can be assigned to more than one storage location.

One in Lincoln Park, one in Naperville and another in Schaumburg.

Right.

Each transport request gets a unique number.

True.

So as soon as you create your transport request, click on new.

It will generate a unique number.

You can try it.

You can try it.

Number four Purchase org or purchase organization can be assigned to a storage location.

No, you cannot.

Again.

You can try it in your system.

Number five.

One plant can be assigned to more than one company code.

That is false.

Again, you can try assigning it.

It.

It does not happen.

I want you to try and do it in the system.

That way you know for sure what the answers are.

Enterprise structure has these two main sections definition and assignment.

There is no evaluation or reporting.

Number seven, create a company called US zero two as a copy of 3000.

It's really easy.

So just like how you copied us zero one from 3000, do another company, code US zero two from 3000

Again, you can create a copy of purchase org us zero two from purchase org 3000.

So this is all hands on.

Same thing create a plant key to.

And you don't need to create these storage locations again.

And you can create these three storage locations and assign them to key two.

Can you create storage locations without assigning to a plant?

No.

Assign the plant to the company code.

So this is where you assign the plant key to that you create to the company code US zero two.

So refer back to the video if you have questions on how to do it.

Assign the purchase order to the plant.

So Purchase Order zero two is going to be assigned to the plant.

CHI2 Do you need to assign a purchase order to the company code?

Not necessarily.
