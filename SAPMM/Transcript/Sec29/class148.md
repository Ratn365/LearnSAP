We have seen in consumption based planning what is called as reorder point based planning.

Based on your past experience, you tend to come up with a number, say £500.

And you set that as a reorder point.

And that is being set manually.

There is also another method to do it, and that's called automatic.

But in order to be able to set a reorder point automatically or rather dynamically.

We need to understand something about consumption called forecasting.

Which is the second method of consumption based planning.

Forecasting.

So what is forecasting?

Let me give you some situations.

You see, consumption is not always constant.

Right.

You take any industry.

Consumption goes up and down.

For example, electricity.

The consumption goes up in winter because of heating and goes down in summer.

Coffee beans.

The consumption goes up during the holiday season.

Winter season and goes down during summer.

Cars.

Cars are sold more in summer and less in winter.

So seasonality meaning summer or winter?

Or holiday season versus non holiday season.

Or there could be a variety of other factors.

Point being, consumption is not constant.

So January, February, March, April, May, June.

The consumption over here is 3000 per month.

And over here, 3800 per month.

If you take coffee beans for £3,600 per month and then maybe November.

It is 4000.

And then in December, maybe 4600.

So the consumption, you know, is something that keeps going up and down.

In typical reorder point based planning, which is what we have seen.

You look at the historic consumption.

You know, it's it's been so much in this month, so much in this month, and you arrive at an average.

Consumption.

Say £3,000.

Per month.

And you divide that by period, by whatever, and you say at any given point in time, I require £500.

Right.

So based on consumption, you arrive at a reorder point.

Manually.

And this is a £500 and this is not by month or by period.

It's a constant £500.

Now, what is the problem with this?

Like I said.

Consumption.

Varies.

By month.

Or by season.

For example, summer versus winter holiday season versus non holiday season.

So in cases like that, a static reorder point cannot really cater to a dynamic consumption pattern.

The consumption pattern is here is very dynamic.

I've had a modest curve here.

3000, 4000 consumption is not very different.

Maybe 30% off here and there.

But.

Imagine something like Amazon.com.

The sales of Amazon.

Goes up.

Say, 20 times or 30 times during holiday season.

Right.

So during that holiday season, the consumption goes up 20 times.

So your typical reorder point based planning does not work in this situation.

So what works?

Patterns work, right?

So it's been historically ten times the consumption during the holiday season.

So during the holiday season, let's talk up ten times.

During the non-holiday season.

The stock has to go down according to the consumption.

So wherever the material is not new.

So we have some level of historic consumption.

And then you know that during this season or this month or this period, there is so much of consumption.

SAP can help you with modeling the consumption and predicting the future requirements.

So forecasting is looking at historic consumption.

And using mathematical models predicting.

Future consumption that is forecasting.
