  - **Timestamp: 00:00 - 03:00**

#### **Section 6: Creating a Material in SAP**

### **Key Points**
1. **Material must be assigned to the correct plant** before it can be used in transactions.  
2. **Material Master Creation Process** includes defining **industry sector, material type, unit of measure, valuation class, etc.**  
3. **SAP's Purchase Order Process** involves multiple master data dependencies (Vendor, Material, and Plant).  
4. **Common Errors & Fixes**:  
   - "Material not maintained for plant" → **Create/extend the material for that plant.**  
   - "Net price must be greater than zero" → **Set a valid price before saving.**
