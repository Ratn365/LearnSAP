Now, let's say we have procured first grade coffee beans.

These are really high quality coffee beans.

Real fresh.

But say after a month, the first grade coffee beans degrade to second grade.

Maybe because they get stale, a bit stale.

Not too stale, just a bit stale.

So this is.

Coffee beans.

Zero one.

That's the material.

Well, let's say there is another material that we sell.

It's second grade coffee beans.

Call it coffee beans.

Zero two.

And the price of this is $1.10 and the price of this is a dollar, 9 or 8.

Now we can procure the second grade coffee beans separately using a purchase order or say, for example,

the first grade coffee beans degrade the second grade coffee beans if you don't use them for a month.

That means if we still have them in stock, you're not able to sell them.

You can very well package them as second grade coffee beans.

Now, how do you do that?

What we are essentially doing from a systems perspective.

Well, from a coffee beans perspective, I think you understand what we are doing.

We are just repackaging the same material, maybe doing a relabeling.

But from a systems perspective, we are essentially converting.

One material to another.

Isn't it?

We are saying £100 of coffee beans of first grade material, coffee beans, or one being converted to

another material.

Second grade coffee beans.

Coffee beans.

Oh two That means if you are converting £100 of this coffee, £100 of coffee, coffee beans, oh one

will be gone out of the inventory, it will vanish and it will be recreated as coffee beans.

Oh two How do you do that?

You use a material type for that?

I think it's somewhere in the 300 range, so let's just do that.

It's done through transfer posting, so go to my go.

And do a transfer posting.

And the material is coffee beans or one.

Plant, Chicago.

Storage location.

Coffee.

And what are we trying to do?

We should be converting a material from one type to another.

So let's see.

Not plant to plant, not remove from storage.

Okay.

There you go.

309.

Transfer posting material to material.

So we are transfer posting from one material to another.

And how much are we doing that for?

£100.

Let's see if there is a material coffee beans.

Oh two.

If not, we can do a coffee material.

Five.

Okay.

Okay, so that's coffee material.

Okay.

So from o one we are converting to O five.

Okay.

I just didn't find o two, so I'm just using o five.

And it's all happening in the Chicago plant coffee storage location.

The quantity that we are converting is 100.

And this is where you put the movement type 309.

Okay, now do a check.

Because we are using coffee material.

Oh five.

Okay, we have a problem.

Okay.

Eliminate all that.

So let's go create a material.

Coffee beans.

Oh, two coffee beans.

Oh two.

And this is of type retail and of type raw material.

Just like coffee beans or even just a different grade.

Go to basic data.

One purchasing, uh, general data and accounting.

Chicago storage location.

Coffee.

Don't you just don't call it second grade.

You just give it a more beautiful name, right?

Like, uh, aged or whatever.

I'm just giving it the same name.

And Pound Material Group 015.

Yeah.

Into the valuation class 3000.

Moving average price.

Enter.

Save.

Okay, so we created another material, Coffee beans zero two.

Now go to my go and do a transfer posting.

What are we doing here?

We are converting £100.

Of coffee beans.

Oh one assuming it's there in the Chicago plant.

Two.

Coffee Beans.

Oh two.

And before we do that, let me open another window and see how much stock we have.

Right.

So be.

Coffee Beans.

Oh one.

And hit.

Okay.

So we are interested in the stock of coffee beans in Chicago plant and coffee beans.

Storage location.

The stock is 205.

Okay.

If you take 100 down or do a conversion for £100, this should go down to 105.

Right?

And then let me open another window.

And see how much stock we have for the material.

Coffee Beans.

Oh two.

We just created it.

So there should not be any stock.

It should be blank.

Right.

So.

Let's go to a transfer posting.

Of what?

Of coffee material.

Oh one.

Right.

And what are we trying to do?

We are trying to do a transposing or conversion from one material type to another or one material to

another.

So it's this 1309 transfer posting material type to material.

Select that or double click it.

Okay.

And.

Hit enter.

So over here, go and select a different material.

So we want to select coffee beans.

Oh two.

Right.

There you go.

This is the target material.

Enter.

Okay, so we are converting from 01202.

And where are we doing that?

We are doing that.

In the Chicago plant.

And coffee beans storage location.

How much for a quantity of £100?

Now do a check, see if everything is okay.

Save it.

Document is posted.

Go refresh this.

You see that from 2005 it went down to 105.

So the quantity of coffee beans zero one, the first grade coffee beans went down by 100.

And this the second grade of coffee beans should have gone up by 100.

Right.

So this went down by 100 and this went up by 100.

And the movement type that we used was 309.

Right.

And maybe after a month, you want to convert it to third grade coffee beans.

Sure.

You can do the same thing.

Same movement.

Type 309.
