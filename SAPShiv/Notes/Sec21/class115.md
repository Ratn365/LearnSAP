When you do a good movement.

There are some side effects.

Right.

We know some of the side effects.

We're just going to formally learn all the side effects.

Whenever you do a good movement.

There are 5 or 6 different things that happen.

They might not happen all the time, but most of the time in some situations, some of them might not

happen.

The first and primary side effect is.

Inventory update.

The inventory either goes up or goes down, depending on the movement type.

Like I said, this need not happen all the time.

For example, in case of goods, receipts or goods issues.

This inventory update happens, right?

You're removing the goods or putting the goods in inventory has to change.

So this is where the quantity changes.

But there are some examples where this does not happen.

Example.

So let's first focus on examples where it happens.

So example.

GR or.

Guy.

So in case of goods, receipts or goods issues, an inventory update happens.

Now, there are some other internal processes where inventory update might happen.

For example, convert a material from one material to another.

In that case, also an inventory update happens.

Now, when you do a transfer posting from quality to unrestricted stock.

In that case, the total inventory in that plant or storage location does not change.

You're essentially moving stock in between one storage type to another.

Right.

So this is no change.

Let me put it with a cross mark.

Another side effect of goods movement is.

Value update.

Where the value of that material changes.

So there is $100,000 worth of coffee, not pounds of coffee worth of coffee.

That could be £10,000 in our plant.

Now you add ten more pounds, the worth of coffee increases by ten multiplied by whatever is the standard

cost or the moving average cost.

So a value update.

This is affected.

By the accounting document.

Referencing that goods movement.

So what happens?

The inventory either goes up or goes down, depending on if it's a goods receipt or a goods issue.

And an offset account either goes up or goes down depending on goods receipt or issue.

The offset account could be a consumption account.

Like a cost center or a grir account.

So that is an example of value update.

A third side effect is consumption.

For example, if you issue goods against a sales order, the customer has placed an order for £10 of

coffee and you've issued the goods against that sales order.

So £10 of coffee is deemed as consumed.

Example.

Goods issue against.

Sales order cost center.

ET cetera.

ET cetera.

Production order.

All of these are examples of consumption.

And what happens?

Consumption either goes up or goes down, depending on what the kind of activity is.

For example, you issue goods against a sales order.

That's an example of consumption increase.

But if the customer returns it, that's an example of a decrease.

Right now.

No change example is scrapping.

In case of scrapping, there is not really any change in consumption.

Or another example is transposing from QA to.

Unrestricted stock in this case.

Also, there is no change in consumption because nothing is really being consumed or.

Receipts, all receipts typically or rather not all receipts, but some other receipts.

For example, receipts against a purchase order.

Nothing is going to happen.

Receipts against.

PIO in this case, consumption does not change.

But when you do a return against a sales order, consumption changes.

So if the original transaction has changed consumption almost all the time, a reversal will also change

consumption in the reverse direction.

So that's another side effect of goods movement.

Another side effect is a reservation.

Reservation.

Update.

Example.

If somebody reserves £100 of goods, it could be a sales order.

Let me put these examples.

Example is a sales order or a production order.

The production order for £10 of cake requires £8 of flour, £1 of sugar, £1 of cream, so on and so

forth.

All of them are reserved, and that takes care of that automatically.

Similarly, when you create a sales order for £10 of coffee, that means the customer is asking for

£10 of coffee.

A reservation will be made for £10 of coffee, and that's automatic.

You can see that in the reservations section.

So a reservation again, either goes up or goes down.

And as usual, not everything will result in a reservation.

Examples are scrapping.

Goods receipt will not result in reservation.

Only upstream transactions like sales orders, production orders, anything that need goods will reserve

stock.

You can also do a manual reservation.

That's a different story.

So reservations are updated as soon as you do the goods movement.

That means a sales order has reserved the stock.

And you have issued stock against that sales order.

Now, that reservation is no longer valid, so that reservation will be updated as done completely.

So that's what I mean by a reservation update.

If it is partially sent out, the reservation will be reduced by so much.

Same with the production order.

So the fifth side effect is order update.

Example is production order.

A production order for £10 of cake after it's received into the warehouse will be deemed as.

Received.

So the corresponding order is updated.

Right.

These are some of the side effects of goods movement, and I have not highlighted all of them.

But some of the side effects.

This probably covers around 70% of all the side effects and.

Should give you a fairly good picture on what are the major side effects of goods movement.

There are other examples which we can see when we touch configuration of goods movement.
