Let's see another example.

Example of issues.

Issue against cost Center.

We have used this a lot of times.

Any time we want to do an issue without reference to a PO or sales order, we use 201.

Right.

All you have to do is go to put 201 material plant and storage location.

And when you put 201, you always put the cost center.

Because that is the cost element or that is the department that's going to suck that cost.

That was another example of issues.

Now there are more kinds of issues you could issue goods against.

Sales order.

Right.

Now, sales order is something that is a little more elaborate.

Now, in order to really test that, we have to do so many different things.

Like do the enterprise structure for sales order, so on and so forth.

The bottom line is it's a little bit more involved.

We don't want to really get there at this point or at any point for an consultant.

So against a sales order, there is a particular movement type.

I think it's 601.

So against the sales order.

So a customer comes in and asks for £10 of coffee, you create a sales order.

Now, we have not seen that in the system yet and we don't need to see them as consultants.

The consultant will create a sales order and he'll create a delivery which will deliver £10 or £1 of

coffee and when it is done.

It's a case of issuing £10 of coffee against a sales order.

And you mentioned the sales order number and the movement type is 601.

What other types of movements are there?

Against.

A project.

What's a project?

Well, think about a birthday party happening in our coffee house.

Let's say we do birthday parties in our coffee shop.

We have a separate room.

Where let's say you come in as a customer and you want to host a birthday party.

Well, we'll assign a helper to you and then you pay in advance, say $100 or $200, and we'll get you

the cakes.

We'll decorate the party.

We'll get coffees, mochas, whatever.

Whatever.

Right.

So all these issues, because these are all issues.

The coffee is made against what?

Not against a customer.

Not against a cost center, but against a project.

And the project in this case is a party.

There is a set budget for it.

Say $600 is the max limit.

And.

And you keep doing that project at the end of the project, all the costs are accumulated.

So we had 100 coffees.

Three big cakes, you know, 100 different pastries.

So many party hats.

So much for decoration.

So much for hosting, so much for the rent, so on and so forth.

And the total is $600 or $900.

So against that project, you keep issuing goods and settle the bill with the customer after the project

is done.

Right?

So the movement type for that is two, two, one.

I could take you to the project systems, create a project, do a goods issue against a project.

But it'll just confuse the hell out of you.

Don't worry.

Think of it as another transaction.

That's it.

Nothing so great about it.

You issue goods against a project?

And when you think of project, think of birthday party.

The movement type that's used is 221.

I just made a note of them offline on paper and I'm just presenting to you, so don't worry about getting

them all into your heart right away.

It's not important.

You can just go to movement types and then see what each of them mean.

Or you could keep this sheet handy.

Take a print out of this, keep it handy, one of your screenshots and refer to this movement types

and you have a question.

Now against an asset.

Asset.

What do you mean by asset?

Coffee making machine.

That's $10,000.

It's a big machine.

That's an asset.

Say, for example, the coffee making machine consumes coffee filters.

Okay.

Coffee filters say we have to replace it every week.

And it becomes part of the asset, right?

Once you replace it with a new one, that new filter becomes part of the asset.

So the asset is the element that's eating the cost of all these filters.

So you keep ten filters in stock and any time a filter replacement is needed, you do a good issue against

the asset and use movement type to 41.

Right.

Now, you could also issue goods against a production order.

There is a special order to produce a £10 cake.

And £10 cake requires, you know, £8 of flour or £2 of sugar.

So much of butter colors, cream, so on and so forth.

Right.

All of them have to be issued for that order.

It's a special order.

The movement type for that is 261.

The baker creates the production order.

And against that production order, goods will be issued using movement type 261.

There are more examples.

Goods issues against internal orders.

So on and so forth.

And each of them have a specific movement type.

So these are all examples of issues.
