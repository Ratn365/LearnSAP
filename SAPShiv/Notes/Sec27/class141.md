The first type of consumption based planning is called manual reorder point.

Based planning.

Manual reorder point.

The key is reorder point.

What is reorder point?

Let's take an example.

Say coffee?

Takes three days to deliver.

And historically, we needed 100 kilos.

Today.

Just one shop, let's say.

Coffee takes three days to procure, and that's called plan.

Delivery.

Time.

Now, this is in case of procurement.

In case of production, it's a different story.

This is in case of procurement.

In case of production.

There is a time, for example, let's say muffins if produced internally, let's say it takes two days.

One day to manufacture them, one day to maybe cool them and keep it ready in the warehouse.

So in which case there is another parameter called total replenishment lead time, and that will be

two days.

In case of procurement, we call it planned delivery time.

Which is the number of days it takes to keep the goods ready.

It's not the number of days that the vendor takes to process her order.

It's not the number of days that the vendor takes to deliver the goods from his warehouse to our warehouse.

It's not the number of takes it takes to stock the muffins or coffee that we receive in our warehouse.

It's all of this time put together.

Meaning if it starts today on a Monday order for a number of pounds of coffee, it will take three days

to sit on our shelves.

Is that clear?

Planned delivery time is the number of days it takes.

From the point of ordering.

To the time goods sit in our shelf.

And that includes order processing time, time, vendor delivery time, vendor lead time, goods, receipt

or goods, stocking time.

All of this put together is called plan delivery time.

So coffee takes three days.

To sit in our shells.

And we are consuming £100 a day.

So let's take a Monday.

So this is Monday.

Tuesday.

Wednesday.

Right.

Every day we need £100.

100 here.

How much stock should you have on Monday?

If we only have a total of £100 and we consume that on Monday, we won't have anything on Tuesday.

Right?

That means.

We should plan ahead.

We should have at least three £400.

Right?

And why am I saying three, £400?

Not like £1,000.

Because every day we keep consuming £100 and it takes three days.

To procure coffee.

That means at least I should have £300 of stock.

Simple logic, right?

On Monday.

If I have £300, I consume £100 and I know that I only have £200, which will only last me two days.

And it takes three days to get coffee.

So on Monday, I place an order with my vendor and he is going to deliver these goods on Thursday.

So £100.

So I'd say, let's say place an order for 300.

So by Wednesday a consume all my 300.

And I have 300 ready by Thursday, so I can use 100 more and then 100 and then 100.

And at this point, I'm going to place another order.

But we are slicing razor thin here.

What if the vendor does not turn up?

What?

If the goods that the vendor has delivered is spoiled.

Point being, you need to have a backup.

So typically.

You'll have a certain amount of safety stock.

Say £200.

Well, again, I'm slicing thin.

You might have a little bit more, but.

Let's just keep the numbers small.

So here is our coffee beans.

Zero x whatever 010203.

And at any given point in time, we need at least £300 because we need it for three days.

Right?

And the vendor takes three days to deliver the goods.

So at least we need to have 300 plus.

Let's put a safety stock just in case the vendor does not turn up or the vendor delivers spoiled goods.

We need to have some level of safety stock.

So total, we need to have a minimum of £500.

In our stock at any given point in time.

Right.

So this is called safety.

Stock.

So it's the stock that we always keep at hand.

Ready?

Although it represents an expense locked up inventory, it's required because we cannot really live

without a certain level of minimum safety stock.

Think of it as a contingency.

And this 500 that we have just calculated to be the absolute minimum below which we should start ordering

again is called.

Reorder.

Point.

And that is what this term here says.

Reorder point.

So if the stock in NB falls below 500.

Go ahead.

Order it again.

Anytime it falls below 500, order it again.

That is reorder point based planning.

Now I'm calling it manual because the 500 that I determined is determined manually.

It not based on some automatic logic.

I said I need £300.

At any given point in time because I know the consumption is on an average £100 per day.

So I need coffee for at least three days because the delivery time is three days.

And then I added a safety stock.

Manually in my mind.

And finally came up with a figure of 500.

The quantity below which if the stock falls down, I'm going to reorder.

Is being calculated manually and that's why it's called manual reorder point based planning.

So let's create this material.

A new material altogether and see how this whole thing works.
