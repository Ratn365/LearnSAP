**Description:** How technology can solve multi-store inventory and procurement issues.

    - **Purchase orders placed**  
    - **Payments & invoices**  

- **[Sub-section 2: Implementing an ERP System (Like SAP)**  
  - A **centralized ERP system** would allow:

    - Automation of **purchasing and invoicing**.  
    - Better financial visibility without manual record-keeping.  
  - The owner can **view reports remotely** instead of visiting each store.  

- **[Sub-section 3: Future Growth with an ERP System]**  
  - As more stores open, a **scalable digital solution** is needed.  
  - A system like **SAP** allows efficient purchasing and stock management.

## **Key Takeaways:**  
- Expanding from **one store to multiple stores** makes manual tracking inefficient.  
- **Multiple locations require centralized stock visibility** to track inventory and consumption.  
- **Dependency on the owner for purchasing** slows down operations.  
- A **manual paper-based system does not scale** beyond a small business.  
- An **ERP system (e.g., SAP) is essential** for managing multi-store operations efficiently.
