Below are suggested answers to the exercise questions:

1. **Can you create a service line item without a cost element?**  
   No. In our examples, every service line item required an account assignment (typically a cost center) to capture the cost. Without a cost element, you cannot create a valid service line item.

2. **Which item category is used for service materials?**  
   The item category for service materials is **D**.

3. **What must be set at the line item level in the purchase order to allow additional service items in the service entry sheet?**  
   You must set an overall service limit (using the Limits tab in the purchase order). This limit defines the maximum value (or hours) for which additional, unplanned service items can be entered.

4. **For service items, when does accounting occur – during goods receipt or during the service entry sheet?**  
   Accounting for service items happens during the **service entry sheet** process—not during a goods receipt.

5. **What is the transaction code for ServiceMaster?**  
   The transaction code for ServiceMaster is **AC03**.

6. **What is the transaction code for the Service Entry Sheet?**  
   The transaction code for the Service Entry Sheet is **ML81N**.

7. **What are the disadvantages of using an analog material (e.g., a non-stock material) for procuring services?**  
   This topic wasn’t covered in depth in the chapter. However, generally, using an analog material for services can be disadvantageous because it does not capture service-specific attributes (like detailed labor hours, service phases, or approval processes) and may lead to less precise cost tracking compared to using dedicated service master data.

8. **Which of the following combinations are possible to maintain service material prices?**  
   There are three ways:  
   - Maintaining a **base price** for the service.  
   - Maintaining prices by **vendor** (different vendors may offer different rates).  
   - Maintaining prices by **vendor and plant** (allowing for location-specific pricing).

9. **There is no need for the user to create a material document for service materials. Is this true?**  
   Yes, that is true. For service materials, you do not create a separate material document because the service entry sheet serves as the official record for the services rendered.
