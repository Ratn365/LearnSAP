### **[Section 4: Exercise Questions & Answers]** *(Timestamp: 7:00 - End)*  
**Description:** Answering common SAP invoice receipt questions.  

- **[Question 1: What is the transaction code to create an invoice receipt?]**  
  - **Answer:** **MIRO**  

- **[Question 2: Does PO History show the invoice details?]**  
  - **Yes**, once an invoice is posted, it appears in **Purchase Order History** in **ME23N**.  

- **[Question 3: What happens if there is a large difference between PO and invoice amount?]**  
  - SAP checks for **tolerance limits** (configured in FI settings).  
  - If the difference exceeds the allowed threshold:  
    - **Warning appears if within tolerance** (manual approval required).  
    - **Hard error if beyond tolerance** (system blocks invoice).  

- **[Question 4: Do you have to check the "Item OK" box for invoices?]**  
  - **No, it is optional** for invoice receipts (unlike Goods Receipt in MIGO).

## **Key Takeaways:**  
- **MIRO is used to enter invoices against a PO.**  
- **Invoices must match the PO amount** to avoid errors.  
- **Once posted, the invoice appears in PO History in ME23N.**
