### **[Section 3: What Happens When the Invoice Amount Differs from PO?]** *(Timestamp: 1:00 - 2:30)*  
**Description:** Understanding how SAP handles invoices that exceed or differ from the PO amount.  

- **[Sub-section 1: Tolerance Configuration in SAP]**  
  - Example: **PO Amount = $400**, but **Invoice = $410 (Exceeds by 10)**.  
  - If the difference is within **SAP's tolerance limit (e.g., 5%)**, the invoice is accepted.  
  - If the difference **exceeds tolerance**, SAP generates **error messages**.  

- **[Sub-section 2: Types of Tolerance Messages]**  
  - **Warning Message**: If the excess amount is within the allowed percentage.  
  - **Hard Error**: If the difference exceeds the configured threshold.  

- **[Final Answer]:** **Invoice differences depend on SAPâ€™s tolerance settings.**  

---

### **[Section 4: Do You Have to Check "Item OK" in MIRO?]** *(Timestamp: 2:30 - 3:40)*  
**Description:** Whether it is mandatory to select "Item OK" while posting an invoice receipt.  

- **[Sub-section 1: Testing Without Selecting "Item OK"]**  
  - Enter **Invoice Amount = 400**.  
  - Click **Save without checking "Item OK"**.  
  - SAP **still accepts the invoice and generates an invoice number**.  

- **[Final Answer]:** **No, checking "Item OK" is not required for invoice receipt.**  

---

## **Key Takeaways:**  
- **MIRO is the transaction code for invoice receipt.**  
- **Invoice details appear in the "Purchase Order History" tab in ME23N.**  
- **SAP uses tolerance settings to handle invoice mismatches** (e.g., 5% allowed variation).  
- **If the invoice exceeds the configured tolerance, SAP issues a warning or error.**  
- **"Item OK" selection is optional in MIRO, unlike in Goods Receipt (MIGO).**
