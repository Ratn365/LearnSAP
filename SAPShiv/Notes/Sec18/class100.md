But still, this.

This is not what we wanted.

So.

317 318, three, 19, three, 2322.

Okay.

Transfer posting quality to unrestricted.

Is that what we want to do?

Quality to unrestricted?

No, we want to do from blocked to quality.

Right.

So keep searching.

Not 322 it's not 323 Quality to quality.

No quality to quality.

No blocked stock to blocked stock.

No blocked stock to block.

Stock reversal.

No blocked stock to unrestricted.

Well, the source is blocked stock, but the destination is not unrestricted.

It's quality.

So this is not the one.

Keep going.

Block stock to unrestricted.

No block Stock to quality.

Well, this is it, right?

We want to post the goods from blocked stock to quality.

So select 349.

Hit enter.

And say item.

Okay and click save.

So effectively we have transferred £100 of coffee from blocked stock to quality stock in the storage

location.

Coffee.

Now, of course, we have got to verify it.

Right.

So this 100 over here now, if I do, a refresh should be gone.

Where should it go?

It should go into quality inspection.

So there should be 100 here and this should still remain the same at 760 or whatever that number is.

So we are moving stock from block stock to quality inspection.

And the movement type for that was 349.

We've already done that.

So let's go refresh it.

All right.

Blocked stock is gone.

The quality has gone up.

The quality has gone up by 100.

And this still remains the same because we have not done anything with unrestricted.

The blocked stock is gone though.

So how do we know that the block stock is gone?

So if we go all the way down below, down to the right, this is the block stock, right?

It's gone.

Earlier there was a 100 there.

Now it's gone.

So this step is done.

So step number one was that we did a goods receipt into the block stock and that was using.

Michael.

Gear against.

This is the step that we do regularly.

Step number two.

Well, we did a tip transfer posting.

From Blackstock to quality stock.

Now somebody in quality is doing an inspection on the coffee.

They are the coffee experts.

And say they found out that out of the, you know, £100, £95 or £90 is okay and £10 has gone bad.

And we don't want to use that in our coffee.

The customers don't like it.

So £90 is passed.

The quality inspection and £10 failed.

So we are going to put the £10 back into blocked stock.

The yellow arrow is showing that it's a reverse movement.

Okay, so this £10 is going to go there and we're going to do that using a transfer posting and the

£90 that the quality inspection has passed can go to unrestricted stock and be used for any purpose.

So the £90 is going to go here.

And that's going to be another transfer posting.

This time it's from quality to unrestricted.

And £10 is going to go from quality to blocked.

How do we do them?

Well, same old transfer posting.

How do we do that?

We know the material is coffee beans and the plant is Chicago.

One.

And the storage location is coffee.

Quantity is £10 that we want to put away into block stock.

So what are we looking for?

We're looking for a movement type.

That we can use to put back stock from quality to blocked.

So it must be right down there in that number range.

320, 30, 40.

So quality to unrestricted?

No.

Uh, quality to quality within plant.

No.

Block to block.

No.

Uh.

Blocked unrestricted?

No.

Block to quality?

No.

Block to quality reversal.

We can use that, right?

So we are reversing the movement from blocked to quality.

So it's a reversal of what we have just done.

So instead of 349, we can do a 350, which just reverses the movement that we have done.

Now, I don't want to reverse everything.

We just want to reverse £10.

Right.

So go save it.

And now out of 100 in quality, ten should be gone.

And where does it go?

Back to block stock.

So refresh this.

And this becomes 90 now and it didn't go to unrestricted.

Instead it went.

To.

It went to Blackstock.

So we have just done this yellow part, moving ten quantity from quality stock to block stock.

Now we are going to do this step.

Step number.

Three.

Move 90.

Quality of coffee that has passed the quality inspection for unrestricted use.

And how do you do that?

We again search for the right movement type.

Since Chicago.

Coffee.

And what is the quantity?

90 Because 90.

Because £90 has passed the quality test.

And where this is where we have to search for the right movement type.

So what do you want to search for?

We want to search for a movement type that moves the goods from quality to unrestricted.

So go down all the way to that range.

320.

There you go.

Quality to unrestricted.

Right.

Transfer Posting quality inspection to unrestricted use.

321.

For a quantity of 90 and click save.

Now if I refresh the screen.

I should see that the quantity of 90 in the stock type quality inspection should go down to zero and

the unrestricted use should increase from 760 to 850.

The 90 should be added to unrestricted use.

Let's refresh this.

All right.

Quality inspection stock is gone and the unrestricted use has gone up to 850.

So you have completed step number three.

So a block stock is stock that cannot be used.

It's blocked.

Quality inspection is in a specific phase.

It's a specific stock type whereby stock is undergoing quality inspection.

So there is hope for that stock.

Some of it might actually be unrestricted.

Unrestricted is the stock type that can be used for any purpose.

It could be sold.

It could be used internally.

It could be used in a project.

It could be used for manufacturing.

Anything you want.

So there are three stock types in blocked quality and unrestricted.

And between each of these stock types, goods can be moved freely.

So if you consider.

Unrestricted.

Blocked.

Quality the vendor when he gets the goods into our warehouse for materials that need a quality process.

You put.

The stock into the quality bucket.

Or quality stock type.

For some goods.

You don't need a quality process, in which case you put it in the unrestricted stock type.

And sometimes because of some anomaly, you could as well put it in the blocked stock type.

And depending on the business scenario, you keep moving it from block stock or quality stock into unrestricted

use because that is the stock type that further processes can use and you can move stock between the

stock types very easily using what's called as transfer posting.

And what differentiates where it's being moved.

The movement type dictates where the stock is going from and into what particular stock type is it being

converted.

So we have just seen one example.

This was 349.

And this.

Is 350.

And this number is 321.

And this number.

The reverse movement is 322.

Now, how about this unrestricted two block?

So this is a 343 and this is a 344 reversal using these six movement types.

You can transfer the stock from block to quality, quality to unrestricted and any which way you want.

So just to quickly summarize, there are three stock types.

Inskeep Blocked quality and unrestricted blocked stock is typically blocked because you're waiting for

something or the stock has gone bad, so you want to return it.

Quality stock is stock that's being inspected for quality.

An unrestricted stock.

Is the star here?

This is stock that can be used for any purpose like manufacturing sales or a project or internal consumption.

So irrespective of how many pounds are.

Kilos of coffee.

The vendor delivers us until it comes to become unrestricted stock type.

You can't really use it.

It's useless.

Block Stock is useless.

Quality stock is useless.

Those are just intermediary steps until it finally becomes unrestricted stock.

So the goal is to have goods in unrestricted stock.

That's the goal of purchasing.

The blocked and quality stock are intermediary steps and you can freely move goods between these stock

types once you have done the necessary steps.

Meaning if you're done the quality check and if you're ready to move the goods, you can use movement

type 321 and move the goods to unrestricted stock.

And in unrestricted stock.

If you found out that some of the goods were broken or damaged, you can send it back using 322.

And same case with all the different movement types.
