 
In this course.

We are going to shift gears and move to another topic in called inventory.

Management.

In short, it's also called I am, if you remember the first part of the series.

I've told you that m m has three pillars on which it stands.

The first pillar is.

Procurement.

The second pillar.

Is inventory management.

And the third pillar is C, B, P, or consumption based planning.

It's a kind of planning that's more closely related to MRP.

So these are the three pillars on which SAP stands.

Now, we have covered some part of procurement, and before we go and understand more of procurement,

like more processes, more configuration.

What we need now is a better understanding of the overall process.

So that's why we are shifting gears and we're going to learn in this course.

So this course is dedicated to Im.

And after that, we're going to move on to CBP consumption based planning.

In general terms, this is called MRP.

But MRP is not just CBP.

There's much more than that.

So what we are going to learn specifically is CBP in the next course.

But this course focuses on inventory management.

And once we have finished Im and CBP, we're going to circle back to procurement, which comprises of

the bulk of SAP procurement comprises probably about 60% of the entire Im.

Im is probably, uh, 25%.

CVP is probably 15%.

So what is im?

Im or inventory management is how the company manages its own inventory.

Say this is our plant or coffee shop.

Chicago.

The vendor.

Supplies the goods into our plant or.

If you don't like the goods, he could as well take that away.

So this is the vendor.

And this entire process is called.

Procurement.

On the other hand, we sell stuff from our plant to our customer, right?

We sell coffee, we sell pastry.

We sell all kinds of things.

This is our customer.

And the customer could return some of the stuff as well, right?

If it doesn't like the coffee, he could return the stuff back to us.

So this process.

Is sales.

So procurement is part of M and sales is part of SD.

Now, where does inventory management fit in?

Of course it's part of M, but in this big picture, where does Iam fit in?

Any movement of goods within the company is called inventory management.

Sometimes it need not even be movement.

I would rather say management of goods within the company.

Is called inventory management.

For example, let's take the same old Chicago plant.

This is the Chicago plant.

The Chicago plant.

Is associated.

Or has.

So many different storage locations.

So what's a storage location?

We know a storage location is just a warehouse or a part of a warehouse.

So there are so many different storage locations.

Right?

One storage location for coffee, one storage location for raw materials, one storage location for

baked goods, movement of goods between raw material and coffee.

Is an example of management of goods that is completely internal to the company.

The vendor doesn't care.

The customer doesn't care.

The ownership of goods is not changing, isn't it?

It's all within the company.

If you have a question on why we do that, think about some simple examples.

The vendor has delivered the coffee, but instead of putting it in the coffee storage location, we

have put it in the raw material storage location.

It's a mistake on our part.

What do we do?

We don't have anything to do with the vendor now.

We just have to move it from the raw material to the coffee storage location.

It's a physical movement of goods, and the storage locations could be like a mile apart or ten feet

apart or cities apart.

Depend.

That depends on how our warehouse and storage locations are set up.

But the point you have to understand is this is completely an internal process.

Internal to the company.

So nothing to do with the vendor.

Nothing to do with the customer.

Nothing to do with any external party.

This is one example of an IEM activity.

Inventory management activity.

Is it only between storage locations?

Not necessarily.

Say, for example, I have a plant.

In San Francisco.

If I move goods between the Chicago plant and the San Francisco plant, or vice versa.

That's also considered an example of internal movement of goods.

Nothing to do with the vendor, nothing to do with the customer or any other external party.

And so it becomes an example of an activity inventory management activity.

Another example.

See in Chicago at the end of the year or at the end of the month, we have to just calculate how much

inventory we have.

Inventory counting is an example of an inventory management activity.

It's internal to the company, right?

We count the inventory, make sure that, you know, what is reflected in SAP is what we have really

a stock.

This just ensures that the system is in sync with what really is there physically.

And it also is a kind of an audit activity.

When I mean audit, it just means double checking.

Don't worry about that word audit.

So inventory management involves movement of goods within the company or across company goods or activities

like inventory counting or activities like quality management.

Another activity is related to quality.

For example, when coffee comes in, you just don't accept it as it is, right?

You have your own internal quality controls.

Check for molds.

We check for color.

Check for flavor.

All different kinds of things.

After you do that.

You put it into your stock.

But until that point, it's stock that's still under inspection.

So how do you differentiate the different stock?

Something that's instilled in quality, which is something that we can readily use?

Well, there is something called stock types that we are going to know.

But quality is an example of an activity that is internal to the company, isn't it?

Nothing to do with the vendor.

If you don't like it, we'll send it back to the vendor.

That's a different story.

But checking for quality is an example of an activity that we do internally within the company.

So movement of goods within the company.

Counting of goods quality.

Are all examples of inventory management activities.

In the next chapter, we'll start with some examples of internal movement of goods.
