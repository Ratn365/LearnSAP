Well, physically, is it happening instantly?

Well, if it just takes, you know, 30 minutes.

Or one hour, then I think it's fine.

It's no big deal.

But if it takes more time than that, say a day or two and you're dealing with large quantities of stock,

it's not just one coffee beans here.

Maybe you're a big chain and you get so many different stock movements happening.

Then.

Anybody who is running an inventory report would get a wrong picture on what's the total value of each

stock because.

This hundred is still not in the coffee warehouse.

It's in the van or the truck.

So there's got to be a better way of doing this.

That better way is through the use of a two step transfer process.

So in two step transfer posting, what you do is you remove stock from the storage location, but you

don't add it instantly here.

Instead, you put it in another column here called Stock in Transit.

Meaning there's going to be a hundred quantity of stock which is in transit.

It's not here yet.

It's not in this storage location yet.

But when you do an inventory report, you'll know what is in the storage location and what is in the

truck.

Stock in transit is what is there in the truck.

Stock in the storage location is what is there in the storage location.

So you're trying to differentiate what physically is with you versus what physically is not there with

you.

That is a two step transfer posting.

The first step is to remove stock.

When you remove it, it's automatically placed in stock, in transit.

And when the truck arrives at the coffee storage location on the eastern suburb.

You're going to move the goods from stock in transit to the actual storage location.

So let's do this.
