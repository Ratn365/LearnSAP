Now if a material is evaluated or not.

Now we know that coffee beans is evaluated.

But if a material is evaluated or not.

Is controlled.

At the material type level.

So a material type.

Plus plant.

Which is basically the valuation area.

Remember, it could be the company code or plan.

Like I said, most of the time it's always the plan.

So at the material type level and plant level, a determination is made.

If the valuation is purely based at the quantity level or at the value level.

Now this will be done in configuration of the material type.

I'll show you that example.

But why would allow something like this?

Why would it not update quantities or values?

Okay.

This is update by quantity.

This is update by value.

Okay.

And what happens during a gr.

The inventory.

Goes up because it's a receipt.

We are receiving goods, so our inventory count goes up and a corresponding Greer account.

Goes down.

Right.

But don't worry about this.

Inventory.

Just understand that your inventory goes up.

Okay.

Now for finished goods or first material type.

Think of examples like muffins.

These are finished goods.

Meaning?

They are manufactured or procured and put on the table and they are just consumed by the customer directly.

As opposed to goods like coffee, which are raw material for the coffee that we make to our customer.

Now in case of finished goods, both the quantity and value are updated.

Because at any time we need to know what is the quantity and what is the value of muffins.

Now think about raw materials.

Coffee beans.

Right.

These are raw materials.

Well, you could sell coffee beans directly in a bag.

But you could also be using coffee beans or raw material.

So in the context of coffee beans acting as raw materials, we need to know how much quantity we have

at any given point in time.

I have £100, £200, £10,000.

And what is the value?

Right.

Well, what about situations like you and VW?

Material type, Which is non valuated.

Non valuated.

What about your VW?

Example, or coffee cups.

Now, most of the time coffee cups need not be counted.

You know, we don't need to care about coffee cups or what is their value.

Either because they are very big questions.

They are used all the time or because they are very low in value.

So most of the time we don't care about the value, but sometimes.

We might care about the quantity of coffee cups because maybe the management wants to know how many

coffee cups we have versus how many copies have been sold because there is a direct relationship between

a cup of coffee and the actual coffee that is being sold.

Maybe they just want to track.

But most of the time they might not be tracked.

But if at all they want to track, they could use something like you and VW material type.

And whereby.

ASAP will count how many coffee cups are there.

But it doesn't care about the value because what's the point in caring about the value of coffee cups?

It's typically trivial.

They are very low value.

Now there is another material type called N lag.

Example stirrers.

This is called Non-stock.

Remember the difference between non stock and non valuated.

Non stock is no stock, no value.

And when I mean no quantity or no stock.

Stock is going to exist.

Of course we need distillers to sell our coffee, but SAP is not going to bother about the stock.

That's called non-stock material.

And remember, when we create a PR, when we create a purchase order for non-stock materials, you always

have to mention a cost center or some other department that's going to take or suck the value of.

Stirrers.

And if you go to type in stirrers as the material, you will not get a quantity.

Why?

Because SAP does not track the quantity of this type of material.

Now, where is this configured?

Where do you tell me that for lag?

Don't maintain quantity for you.

Maintain quantity.

Where do you specify that?

Of course, it's under SPRO.

So go to SPRO.

IMG.

Instead of going to material management, go to logistics, General.

And here go to Material Master.

Basic settings and material types.

Go to material type and define attributes of material type.

Go to firt f e r t.

Select or double click it.

And you see this quantity and value updating.

So you're saying that in all valuation areas you update quantity and update value?

And they go to quantity and value of dating.

And you see that for Chicago plant.

The quantity is updated and the value is updated.

Now, if you take another material type, say you and VW.

U n b.

W.

Double click that and go to quantity value updating.

And for the Chicago plant, only the quantity is updated, but the value is not updated.

So for a material.

If we are going to track the value or the quantity or both is determined at the material type and plant

level.

Because for certain plants you don't need to track and for certain plants you might want to track.

This is all configured right here.
