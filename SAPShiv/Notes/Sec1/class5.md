    1. **Server Address** (Domain or IP).  
    2. **Instance Number** (Provided by the SAP administrator).

### **[Section 4: Executing Transactions in SAP]** *(Timestamp: 4:30 - 6:30)*  
**Description:** Understanding how to execute transactions using menus and transaction codes (T-codes).  

- **[Sub-section 1: Using the Menu Path]**  
  - The SAP menu structure is **hierarchical**, like Gmail's categories.  
  - Example:  
    - To create a **Purchase Order**:  
      1. Go to **Logistics → Material Management → Purchasing → Purchase Order → Create**.  
    - Similar to clicking through folders or menus in an application.  

- **[Sub-section 2: Using Transaction Codes (T-Codes)]**  
  - Every transaction has a **technical name** (T-Code).  
  - Example: **ME21N** → Create a Purchase Order.  
  - Enable T-Codes in the SAP menu:  
    - Go to **Extras → Settings → Enable Transaction Codes**.  

- **[Sub-section 3: Executing Transactions**  
  - Two ways to run a transaction:  
    1. **Via Menu Path** → Navigate through hierarchical menus.  
    2. **Via Command Field** → Enter T-Code directly (e.g., **ME21N**) and press Enter.  

- **[Sub-section 4: Adding Transactions to Favorites]**  
  - Frequently used transactions can be dragged to the **Favorites** section for quick access.

  1. **Menu Navigation** (Hierarchical structure).  
  2. **Transaction Codes (T-Codes)** for faster access.  
- **T-Codes like ME21N** simplify access to key transactions.
