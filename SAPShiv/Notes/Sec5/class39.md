### ✅ **Answers to the Exercise:**  

1️⃣ **Sales Org 1 and Sales Org 2 views are available in Material Type – True or False?**  
   - ✅ **True** → Sales Org 1 & Sales Org 2 views are available for **finished goods (FERT)** and **trading goods (HAWA)**, as they are relevant for sales.  
   - ❌ **False** → If the material type is non-stock (NLAG) or raw materials (ROH), these views are not available.  
   - **How to check?** → Go to **MM01**, enter material type, and see the available views.  

2️⃣ **Material Type HAWA (Trading Goods) has a Work Scheduling View – True or False?**  
   - **❌ False** → Trading goods **(HAWA)** are **not manufactured**, so they do not require a **work scheduling view** (used for production planning).  
   - **Check in MM01** → Select **HAWA**, and you won’t see the **Work Scheduling** view as an option.  

3️⃣ **Non-stock Material Type NLAG does not have a Warehouse Storage Location View – True or False?**  
   - ✅ **True** → **NLAG (Non-stock material)** is **not managed in inventory**, so it does not require a warehouse view.  
   - **Check in MM01** → If you select **NLAG**, you won’t see a **warehouse storage location** view.  

4️⃣ **Non-evaluated Material Type UNBW (UNB) has an Accounting View – True or False?**  
   - **❌ False** → **UNBW (Non-valuated materials)** do not carry a **valuation**, so they do not require an **accounting view**.  
   - **Check in MM01** → Select **UNBW**, and you won’t see an **accounting view** available.

**📌 Next Steps:**  
- Try checking different **material types (ROH, FERT, HAWA, NLAG, UNBW)** in **MM01** to observe their available views.  
- Let me know if you need **customized practice scenarios** for materials and procurement! 🚀
