### **Structured Summary of the Transcript (Part 4)**  

#### **Section 12: Understanding Master Data in SAP**  
This section introduces **Master Data**, focusing on **Material Master** and its importance in SAP.  

- **[Sub-section 1: Types of Materials in a Coffee Shop]**  
  - **Raw Materials:** Flour, pastry sheets, coffee beans, baking sheets, stirrers.  
  - **Finished Goods:** Croissants, pastries, tarts, cakes, muffins.  
  - **Trading Goods:** Newspapers (procured and sold without processing).  
  - **Each material type has specific attributes and views in SAP.**  
  - **Timestamp: 00:00 - 04:00**  

#### **Section 13: Material Views in SAP**  
Each material has multiple **views** (data categories) for different aspects of business operations.  

- **[Sub-section 1: Explanation of Views]**  
  - **Warehouse View:** Defines storage conditions (e.g., cold storage for sugar).  
  - **Accounting View:** Determines how transactions for the material are recorded.  
  - **Costing View:** Specifies cost calculation methods (manufactured vs. procured).  
  - **Purchasing View:** Contains procurement settings.  
  - **Manufacturing View:** Needed for in-house production but not required for procured goods.  
  - **Sales View:** Only necessary for materials that are sold.  
  - **Timestamp: 04:00 - 08:00**  

- **[Sub-section 2: How Views Vary by Material Type]**  
  - **Raw Materials (Flour, Coffee Beans):** Needs Purchasing, Accounting, and Warehouse views.  
  - **Finished Goods (Muffins, Pastries):** Requires Manufacturing, Sales, and Quality views.  
  - **Trading Goods (Newspapers):** Needs minimal views (Purchasing & Accounting).  
  - **Low-Value Items (Stirrers, Baking Sheets):** Often lack Planning, Quality, and Costing views.  
  - **Timestamp: 08:00 - 12:00**  

#### **Section 14: Importance of Material Type in SAP**  
Material type determines **which views are available** for a material and how it is treated in transactions.  

- **[Sub-section 1: Common Material Types in SAP]**  
  - **Finished Goods (FERT):** Croissants, cakes (ready for sale, no further processing).  
  - **Raw Materials (ROH):** Flour, coffee beans (used for production).  
  - **Semi-Finished Goods (HALB):** Pastry sheets (partially processed materials).  
  - **Trading Goods (HAWA):** Newspapers (purchased and sold without modification).  
  - **Non-Stock Materials (NLAG):** Stirrers, baking sheets (not counted in inventory).  
  - **Timestamp: 12:00 - 16:00**  

- **[Sub-section 2: Special Material Categories]**  
  - **Non-Evaluated Materials (UBW):** Stock is tracked, but value is not assigned (e.g., coffee cups).  
  - **Non-Stock Materials (NLAG):** Used frequently but not counted (e.g., stirrers).  
  - **Understanding Material Types Requires Transactions:** Viewing stock/value updates helps clarify distinctions.  
  - **Timestamp: 16:00 - 20:00**

### **Key Points**  
1. **Master Data in SAP Includes:**  
   - **Material Master** (Product Information).  
   - **Vendor Master** (Supplier Information).  

2. **Material Categories:**  
   - **Raw Materials (ROH)** â†’ Flour, coffee beans.  
   - **Finished Goods (FERT)** â†’ Cakes, muffins.  
   - **Semi-Finished Goods (HALB)** â†’ Pastry sheets.  
   - **Trading Goods (HAWA)** â†’ Newspapers.  
   - **Non-Stock Materials (NLAG)** â†’ Stirrers, baking sheets.  
   - **Non-Evaluated Materials (UBW)** â†’ Coffee cups (tracked in quantity but not in value).  

3. **Material Views in SAP:**  
   - **Warehouse View:** Storage conditions.  
   - **Accounting View:** Financial transactions.  
   - **Costing View:** Price determination.  
   - **Purchasing View:** Procurement details.  
   - **Manufacturing View:** Used for in-house production.  
   - **Sales View:** Required only for items sold to customers.  

4. **Material Type Dictates Available Views** â†’ Determines how materials are managed in SAP.
