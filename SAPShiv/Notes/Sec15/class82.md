If this prize can be used only one time, then all we can do is take that quotation, create a purchase

order, and use it.

But if it can be used for a long time, then we can convert that into what is called as a source of

supply.

So like I said, we have successfully completed.

The quotation process, and out of that, one successful bidder emerged.

You would accept more than one.

That's a different story.

Let's just say for simplicity that we have accepted 4003 as a successful bidder.

Now, if it's a one time offer, meaning he's willing to offer us 100 kilos of coffee at this price,

you know, for ten days or five days or 20 days, we could use that quotation.

And convert that into a.

It should appear to the vendor, get the goods, pay the invoice, the process is complete.

But if the vendor is ready to supply these goods to us on a long term basis, meaning forever at that

price, then we've got a win.

Right.

So out of all these vendors, this vendor is supplying the goods to us forever at 8.95 per pound.

That means we can use this vendor as the source of supply for a long time.

If you want to test the vendor, maybe the quality is good or not.

We don't know.

Then we can just create a PO, receive the goods.

Receive the invoice and then check if the coffee tastes good, what is the customer feedback, so on

and so forth.

And if we like the coffee and of course we like the price, then like I said, we can convert this quotation

if the vendor is ready to supply the goods on a long term basis, we can convert this into what's called

as a source.

Of supply.

Is the source of supply.

A source of supply.

Is just a set of data that we can use again and again to create purchase orders.

Right.

So whenever we want coffee, we can use vendor 4003.

And what are the modes in which you maintain the data for 4003 at this price?

There are three ways, primarily in which you can create a source of supply.

And we have seen all of these sources of supply already.

The first source of supply is a purchase info record.

The second source of supply is a contract.

The third source of supply.

Is a scheduling agreement.

How do we create this?

Well, creating this is no big deal.

But how do we use them?

A purchasing info record can be used to create a view.

Right in the purchase room for record, you set a price of 8.75 or whatever price this vendor has agreed

on.

And when you set that and every time you create a PO with this vendor, this purchase info record will

be used and you get the best price.

Now.

Same thing with the contract.

Using this quotation, we can convert that quotation into a contract, and any POA that you create further

can reference this contract.

And of course you're going to get that price of $1 875 the best price that was offered.

Now same thing with scheduling agreements.

You can convert that quotation into a scheduling agreement also.

So if you know that you're going to require 100 quantity every week, you can create a scheduling agreement

and the price is going to be 875 because we have created that with reference to this quotation.

And you don't even need to create polls, right?

When the date is right, based on the delivery schedule, you get the goods and then you get the goods

and invoices at $8.75 per pound.

Now let's see how we can do them.
