 
In this chapter, we will talk about another kind of return.

These returns are called return.

Pius.

As opposed to a return delivery.

So it's not a return delivery, but it's a return po.

So what's the difference between a return delivery and a return Po?

Well, we know what's a return delivery, right?

This is a return.

Delivery.

And what's the return delivery?

So we have a PO.

Against which we receive goods.

And we also receive an invoice, say, for a quantity of 100.

100 kilos of coffee and we want to return some of the stuff.

Like 50 kilos of coffee.

Right.

So we create.

A goods issue is not a goods receipt, but it is a goods issue because we are issuing the goods out

of our warehouse and we are doing a goods issue for say, 50 quantity and then we'll also do an invoice.

And that is for a quantity of 50 that we received from the vendor.

So this is a return delivery.

So this invoice receipt is also called a credit.

Memo.

Right.

So this is M 21 n.

This is my go.

This is Miro.

Same here.

My goal.

Middle.

You just select different options in my my row depending on the transaction that you're doing.

Right.

So this is a return delivery.

Now we're going to talk about return.

So to understand return, let's take an example in our coffee shop.

We sell newspapers, right?

Say we sell New York Times.

How many do we sell?

Maybe 50 a day.

Right.

But we don't know how many we sell.

So we typically get like 75 or 100 every day.

And we shall however many we can.

Right.

So how does this process work?

There is a PO.

That gets you 100.

100 newspapers every day.

Right.

And we receive 100.

And we get an invoice for 100.

Right.

And this happens, say, every day.

This is not ideal.

There are other ways to do it, but say this happens every day.

So this is a poll for 100 every day, 100 quantity of New York Times.

And we receive 100 newspapers every day into our goods and we receive an invoice for 100 every day.

Now, we might not sell all the 100, isn't it?

We might sell 50.

We might sell 75.

We might sell 25.

What happens to the remaining newspapers that we accumulate every day that we don't sell?

Well, newspapers, magazines, bread, this kind of goods.

They expire by the day.

Right.

So bread expires in, say, two days.

Newspaper expires in one day.

By the time it's evening.

Nobody cares about your newspaper, right?

So the industry works in a different way there.

Newspapers are delivered to, you, say, in quantity.

If you only sell 50, they take the remaining 50 back.

They give you money for the remaining 50.

Right.

So say, for example.

On day one, say Monday.

You buy 100 in a oppo, but you only sell 50.

So this is by.

This is cell.

And remaining.

Is 50.

Right on day two.

Same quantity of 100 you sell 75 and remaining is 25.

Day three.

Say 100.

And you sell 100 remaining zero day for 100.

And this will say 60 remaining.

40.

So.

So you get you get the picture, right.

So at the end of the week, say we are cutting short the week by four days at the end of the week.

You have 50 plus 25, 75 plus 40, 115, I think.

I'm not very sure, but it doesn't matter.

So at the end of the week, there are 150 newspapers, old newspapers that we have accumulated for the

entire week.

Available to be returned.

Right now.

You don't want to go to the individual GR and start doing good issues.

It's very cumbersome.

And you typically do it when there is defective goods or for some reason you want to return stuff.

But this is not just returns.

You don't want to even consider them as sale.

Right.

So this type of situation is handled using a return po.

The PO itself is not for delivery of goods into our warehouse, but for returning the goods to the vendor.

But the original intention of this po or this.

Po is not that we want 100 quantity.

We want 100 quantity of coffee.

We want 100 quantity of newspapers.

But this time what we are going to do is end of the week.

What we do is we create a return.

Okay, so it's going to be like this.

Think of this as return and then it's going to be a PO.

It's a different kind of po.

We will talk about that.

And that's going to be for a quantity of 115 New York Times newspaper at whatever price you're going

to get it back.

And.

You do a good issue.

Of 150, and that goes out from our warehouse.

And then what do you do?

You do an invoice.

Right.

And that's also what a quantity of 115 that goes out of our warehouse.

The difference between this and this PO is that at the line item level.

You mark that as a return.

That's what triggers this new kind of process.

Everything else remains the same.

You just mark that line item as return, and then subsequent processes automatically adjust themselves

to be a good issue.

For example, as opposed to goods receipt or a credit memo as opposed to an invoice receipt.

Right.

So let's do this in action.

So first thing we're going to do is.

Create this cycle.

And the second thing we are going to do is create this cycle.

Right.

And in order to do that, first we have to create the New York Times material.

How are we going to create it as a trading goods?

How are.

We are trading it right.

It's not raw material for us.

It's not finished goods.

It could be finished goods, but we don't care.

We could do it as a trading material.

It's easier that way.

So step number one, create.

New York Times.

Us.

How about trading goods?

Let's do that.

How do you create a material?

Zero one.

Right.

So go to zero one.

And type in New York Times.

Call it retail and use.

How?

Trading goods enter.

And we only want to create three views write basic data, one purchasing and accounting.

And that's for the plant of Chicago.

Okay.

New.

New York Times basic unit of measure each.

It's not our or it's not kilos.

It's each for material group.

Just put in something for now.

Purchasing group.

Anything is fine.

And valuation class 3100 and its moving average because it's trading goods has automatically picked

up the price control as moving average because it knows that we're going to buy and sell.

Which is more relevant for moving average as opposed to manufacturing, which is more relevant for a

standard cost.

Okay.

All right.

Save it.

Enter.

All right.

So we got New York Times there.

So this step is complete.

And the second step is create.

Bio.

For a quantity of 100.

Easy, right?

So go to 21 and.

Select the same vendor.

Doesn't matter.

Any vendor is fine and select New York.

Times for a quantity of 100.

Say the price is $1 each, so 100 into one is $100.

Save it.

As usual.

Copy the PO.

Now receive the goods.

Against this.

How many are we receiving?

A quantity of 100.

Where are we receiving into?

Uh, let's say 001.

Right.

Save it.

Okay, material document is posted and we're also create an inbound invoice.

Today's date and the PO goes here.

So it's for a quantity of 100.

And the amount is 100.

Save it.

So we have created a PO.

Three.

The goods receipt.

Step number four did an invoice receipt.

Okay.

We're good.

Say, we have been doing this for like seven days a week, seven purchase orders.

And like I said, we have accumulated a quantity of 115 in our warehouse.

Right?

Right now we don't have 115.

So let's say we have accumulated 150 At the end of the week we are going to do a return po.

Return.

Purchase order.

Like I said, the way you create a purchase order is very simple.

It's the same step Create.

PIO for New York Times with the same vendor.

So it could be like, say, 100, 150 and whatever.

Right?

Because we don't have a quantity of 115.

I'm just using a quantity of 100.

And I said the difference is marking the line item as a return.

So how do you do that?

If you scroll all the way to the right, there is a column called Returns Items.

Just check it.

And hit enter.

So this item is being marked as a returns item.

Now, one item could be returns.

The next item could be a regular item.

No problem.

Now save it.

There we go.

We have our new.

Copy it.

Then we're going to do a goods issue.

Right.

Select that po and.

You see.

It's the movement type that's selected.

Here is a GR returns.

Right.

If it were a regular item, like a regular purchase order inbound, it would have selected a different

movement type.

Now, we don't understand movement types yet, but that's fine.

The point being SAP automatically recognizes that it's not an inbound receipt, but it's a return.

And how does it recognize it?

Because we have marked that item in the PO as a returns po.

So.

Item.

Okay.

And we are returning a quantity of 100.

We could return 100.

We could return 75.

We could return however many you have.

And save.

And where are we returning them from?

0001 Because that's where we have kept our.

Newspapers and save.

Cool.

Now we're going to enter the invoice for today's date and.

Put the number in there.

Enter an amount of 100.

And instead of an invoice select credit memo because it's a credit that we are giving, right.

And the balance will tell you if you need to give a credit or a regular invoice, if you try to create

a regular invoice like so.

You see the balance becomes 200 negative.

And if you go to the messages, it will show you that the invoice document will be negative.

Right.

So that's not what we want to do.

We want to create a credit memo because it's a credit that we are going to get when we want.

When we return, a 100 quantity of these newspapers because it's a return item.

It's not a regular inbound item.

So we are good to go and save it.

Right now.

Let's go back to that purchase order.

And go to the purchase order history and see what happened.

So we sent out the goods of Quantity 100 and that's why we have 100 minus.

And.

We have created a credit memo for a quantity of 100.

So what we have done essentially is created a PO.

Mark that item as return item.

This is the key to make it a return PO.

Then did a goods issue so you don't have to select anything in the dropdown.

Just go to my go, put that number in there and the system will automatically determine if it should

be a return or an inbound.

And step number three is create an invoice receipt.

For a credit memo.

So this is Return.

Poe Now, in the next chapter, we are going to talk about credits and debits.
