 
So let's summarize what we have done in Material Master.

Like we discussed at the beginning of the Material Master, there are three topics that we wanted to

discuss.

You want to discuss the common fields?

And their significance.

Example material group basic unit of measure E and UPC codes, so on and so forth.

These are things that we haven't discussed elsewhere in the context of another concept.

For example, Autopia is a flag.

We have discussed that when we have covered Autopia creation, so we did not cover that here.

Any field that was not covered elsewhere as part of a separate topic was covered as part of common fields.

And we covered mostly the fields that are in the basic view and purchasing.

We did not cover sales because that's not part of our curriculum.

We did not cover most of it because that's again, not part of our curriculum.

We covered only the basic purchasing and accounting fields.

Next thing is material type customization.

So we have covered all the possible customization that we can do with material type.

Like first, how do you create new material types you copy from an existing material type?

We have discussed why we need to copy.

What is the effect of an upgrade?

What is the new nomenclature that they need to start with Z or Y?

And the most used customization in the material type.

The third one was field and screen level customization.

Here we've talked about how to add and remove fields from the material master, how to make fields mandatory

or optional, or display how and how fields are grouped, and what is a field reference and how it is

assigned to the material type.

And we have also seen that customization of the screen is not our area.

Only an Abap consultant can do it for us using the screen painter and a bit of coding.

For us as functional consultants, we have to identify why we are doing a certain change.

Document it as part of a functional spec.

Give it to the technical consultant.

Okay, that concludes material, Master.
