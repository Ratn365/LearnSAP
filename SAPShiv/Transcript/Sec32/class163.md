 
The next parameter is N and UPC numbers.

What's n UPC?

Ian stands for European.

Article.

Number.

An UPC stands for Universal Product.

Code.

What are these?

Now, if you are in the retail industry, this is mostly used in retail.

Think about shoes.

Think about clothing.

Think about anything that's retailed.

Typically, you know.

These products have a barcode.

Right.

And what does that barcode do?

It represents that material in a unique way across any shelf.

Meaning.

If you take that shirt or shoe, let's say a Nike shoe.

A particular model.

A particular model will have a UPC code.

Say, I think UPC is a 12 digit code and Ian is a 13 digit code.

The UPC.

Is given by a consortium.

You know, there's an organization that assigns or allocates a unique code to your particular model

of Nike.

And that model of Nike, be it on the stores of Foot Locker or be it on the stores of Payless Shoe Store,

it still has the same product code.

So it's a way to uniquely identify a material.

Same thing with European article number.

This is used in EU and Asia and this is used mostly in North America, Australia, New Zealand.

I got to know about this UPC and Codes when I was working with an apparel company.

They made shoes and apparel, and that was the first time I was introduced to eons and upcs.

It's very retail oriented.

All right.

They were using it for labeling and as value added services.

Not every company needs these.

Typical B2B companies don't need them.

Now, if you are in retail, you might need an UPC.

If the customer end user is interacting with them a lot.

On the retail shelves, then you need an UPC, right?

These numbers will be allocated by a consortium and they'll just be assigned to the materiel master.

So where do you do that M0 to?

Again, it doesn't make sense for coffee beans or maybe it makes sense because you could package coffee

beans and put them on the shelves of Safeway, right?

Or Costco, in which case it might have a unique product number.

So an UPC, this is where you put your numbers or UPC numbers.
