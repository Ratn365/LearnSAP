 
The second parameter that we're going to discuss is the external material group.

What is an external material group?

In our coffee shop.

We try to distinguish between coffee and non coffee goods when marking the material as belonging to

either coffee or non coffee.

So we created a material group called Coffee and assign that to any coffee related materials.

Now we know which material is coffee related and which material is not coffee related.

Now if you're still confused about material groups.

Think of it as the classification that we do in, say, a supermarket or a grocery store.

You go to Safeway.

And there is classifications, right?

What kind of classifications?

This grocery.

There is dairy products.

There's cereals there, spices, there's bread section, and then there's chips and soda.

Why does a supermarket do this classification?

Because if there are 1000 products or hundreds of products at least.

Human mind tries to classify things.

If you don't classify, everything is out there without classification.

If you want to go identify something, how would you do it?

You'd have to be helped with some kind of classification material.

Group just serves the same purpose.

I talked about fancy things like operational purposes, analytical purposes.

That's all.

Okay.

But to put all of this simply in plain English.

Think of all the classification that happens in a supermarket.

And why would you want to do that?

Because humans understand groupings of things.

When there are hundreds or thousands of materials, you can't really think about each material in particular.

You got to group them.

And that's the reason why material groups exists.

Now external material group.

Could be used for any reason.

One of the reasons why I have used external material groups is.

Internally, we tend to think of our materials as coffee and non coffee.

But externally.

The market or the customer.

Would want to think of that material as something else.

For example, if you take the auto industry internally, you would want to classify all your say.

For example, Honda classifies all their materials according to some internal classification.

But the external face of it, meaning the customer would want to see it as SUVs and sedans and hatchbacks.

Right.

That's how the customer views it.

The dealer might view it as high volume sales, Low volume sales.

Medium volume sales.

High value sales.

High discount sales.

High margin sales.

Right.

He's interested in selling them.

So he looks at things from a sales perspective.

The customer looks at things from a usability perspective.

And the transporter thinks of that same product from something else.

The company.

Honda itself thinks of these products as something else.

They might tend to think of the technology and whatnot.

So an external material group is grouping the same material.

According to an external view.

What's the most important external view for Honda?

Probably their customer.

So internally they might have n different types of material groups.

Right.

Um.

EV vehicles.

Non EV vehicles.

Automatic drivetrain manual drive.

Train four wheel drive.

Two wheel drive.

Different kinds of classifications.

But from a customer's perspective, there is.

Issue.

There's a hatchback.

And.

There's a sedan.

Simple enough, right?

Or broad classification based on how the customer wants to look at it.

Now, what purpose does it serve?

The same purpose that a typical material group works.

So in this case, Honda is classifying their.

Materials according to drive, train or.

Technology or whatever, and they could use that for internal reporting and analytics.

And if they want to identify how the customer is looking at things and do some reporting or some kind

of analytical extraction.

Based on how the customer is looking at things.

You can use the external material group.

How many SUVs did we sell?

How many sedans did we sell?

How many hatchbacks did we sell?

What's the profit margin on hatchbacks versus sedans?

What's the sale of SUVs in winter versus the sale of SUVs in summer?

Right.

These are all some of the reports that you could be using by looking at the same product from a customer's

perspective.

And that's not the only perspective.

You could look at customers perspective.

You could look at dealers perspective.

You could look at the market perspective.

Because the market in general, the share market could be looking at things differently.

They could be grouping things differently based on how they look at things.

Right.

So an external material group is used to classify.

The same material based on somebody else's perspective customer, material, market, dealer, whatever.

Right.

And and where do you create them?

You create them here.

Just like how you create a material group.

Create them here.

New entries.

Sedan.

Right.

Sedan.

Sedan.

So we have created a new external material group called Sedan.

And you could go and.

Assign it to the material master.

So go to zero to coffee beans, basic data and external metal group as sedan.

Now, it doesn't make sense to assign a sedan to a coffee, but you get the point, right?

That's external material group.

Now, the third point is.

Old.

Material number.

So if we go to zero two coffee beans, basic data.

This is the old material number.

What is an old material number?

All material number is the material number that you use to call this material before you implemented

SAP.

What do I mean by that?

It's not necessary that every implementation of SAP is brand new.

Meaning.

So there's a company.

It doesn't start off with SAP, right?

No company starts off with SAP.

So there's a company like my coffee shop.

I start off with QuickBooks.

Which is probably a $100 a $1,000 software run on it after two years, my sales increase.

I'm doing a lot of money.

And I move on to some system, right?

Some ERP.

And after a few years, I get into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

And then now I want to implement SAP.

What happens to all those customers and all those materials and vendors?

I have to recreate them.

Or migrate them from this, some ERP, whatever it is, into SAP.

And when I do that, the old material for coffee is called coffee.

Or one in SAP.

We want to call them 1101215 or c o f f e beans zero one instead of coffee.

Oh one.

Because we think it's a better naming convention.

But people in the company are so used to this material, right?

So there should be some way in SAP to be able to tag.

The old material number with the sap s new material number.

And that's what this does in SAP.

Coffee beans or one is called coffee beans.

Oh one It's coffee beans, French roast.

And in the old material, they used to call it coffee Dash zero one.

You see.

Now anybody can go in and see what's the old material number and find out the relationship between the

old material number in Non-sap system and the new material number.

Right.

It's a mapping between what the material used to be called in the legacy system.

This is what I call my legacy system.

Something that precedes SAP and SAP is the modern ERP.

That's the reason why you use old material group.

Now, if there is no old system or legacy system, you have been on SAP for quite some time, then you

can use this field old material number for some other kind of reporting, any kind of reporting that

you want.
