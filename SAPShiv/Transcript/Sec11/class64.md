 
All right, it's all the exercises, can you create a service line without creating a cost element?

No, you cannot.

You always have to include a cost element.

Remember, there were two things that the line item level that we had to do to make it a service item.

The item category had to be said today, this was the primary driver to make that line item service

and service line items always need a cost element.

Somebody has to eat that cost and that somebody, the Department of Order or the production order or

whatever has to be specified in the account assignment field.

Second question, the item category for service is D, so if you answer the first question, you almost

answered the second question, right?

Which of the following is necessary to end additional Leonard in service, in pursuit?

Not delivery schedule, not grass praise, but limit.

Remember, we have set a limit of hundred dollars on the line item level and without setting that limit,

we were not able to enter unplanned items in the service center issued.

Number four, for service items, accounting happens.

Well, well, it doesn't happen in the service and it it happens in the recede, but the trick here

is you don't do the good receipt physically yourself.

You just do the service receipt.

And this automatically does a good seat with a dummy material and creates the material document.

No final transaction to create the ServiceMaster Akrotiri transaction code for service in receipt is

Emelle EIGHTY-ONE and.

And like I said, just go effort to write a system for transaction costs.

What are the disadvantages of using analog material for procuring services?

Well, for starters, adding additional materials at the grassroots level is not an ideal way.

It breaks the link between the purchase order and the receipt.

Well, there is a way to automatically create a P.O., but that's convoluted, number one.

And number two, it breaks the relationship between the purchase order and the receipt.

There's really no elegant way in which you could add more services at the grassroots level.

And that's the reason why we could not use analog material to order services.

Which of the following combinations are possible and standard asep to maintain surface materials?

Well, when transmitted is possible, yes, service and plant is possible.

Yes, vendor service material.

And the plant is also possible and service material is also possible, just the service material.

So all of these are possible?

No, there's no need for the user to create Magal transaction for service materials.

That's true.

We don't need to create it.

We just need to do the service and she'd save it, accept it and.

A transaction and a material document will automatically be created behind the scenes.
