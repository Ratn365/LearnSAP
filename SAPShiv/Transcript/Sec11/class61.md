 
During the service entry sheet.

If you remember, we had to always enter the prices $10 per hour for basic electric service or $20 per

hour for Advanced electric service.

Just like how we maintain price lists or info records for regular physical materials or non-stock materials,

can we maintain the price for services?

Well, the answer is yes.

How do you do that?

So go to ServiceMaster.

Service and service conditions.

There are three ways in which you can maintain prices for services.

You can just maintain the base price.

So electric service, base price $10 per hour.

Or you could say for the Chicago plant, the price is $11 per hour for basic electric service.

And for Chicago, the price is $12 because the price for service could differ by city or plant.

Also the services could differ with vendor vendor 4001 A, B, C, Foods or ABC Electric Services could

supply a basic electric service for $11 and somebody else could deliver the same service for $9.

So the price of a service is basically dependent on plant, which is the location that you're procuring

the services for and the vendor who is supplying that service.

Right.

So you could maintain prices for a service for any of these possible combinations.

Or you could do it standalone.

So let's see how we do that.

So go to service service conditions and click on Add.

And over here you could enter the materials or services.

So click Serve zero one.

The amount is $10 per hour.

And unit is used.

And electric service.

And electric service advanced is going to be $20 per hour.

And labor.

Is going to be $10 per hour.

Right.

You can save it.

Now go back and try and maintain the same prices with plant or without plant.

So without plant is going to be like this.

So for purchase or US zero one.

So for vendor 4001 basic electric service is going to cost, say, $12.

And Advanced Electric Service is going to cost $22.

And.

Neighbor.

Is going to cause a $9.

Okay, Save it.

Also, you could create it for a combination of plant and material.

So for vendor 4001, if it is Chicago plant.

And for basic electric service.

The amount is $13.

So Chicago say is expensive and.

Advanced Electric Services so much Labor is a $12 and save it now.

You could maintain this for the same vendor for a different plant, says the plant.

If you have created a plant with a different set of prices.

This is how you maintain prices.

Now if you create.

Now if you create another purchase order like so M 21 n.

Vendor.

Account assignment.

K Item category.

D We call it pump repair.

For a quantity of one.

And the services that are required are basic electric service.

Admin department is going to cover the costs.

You see, the price has automatically come up here.

Right.

And where is this coming from?

This is coming from the prices that we have maintained.

So let's see what we have done in this chapter.

Every time a service material was being entered in the service entry sheet or the purchase order, we

had to enter the price, right?

Otherwise it was showing that message.

So just like physical deliverables or non-stock materials, can we maintain a price list?

So for physical materials like raw materials or non-stock materials, we maintain the prices in the

purchase info record.

For service materials.

We maintain the prices in ServiceMaster.

We can maintain the prices in three different ways.

We can maintain a base price, which is just the price for that service material.

Or we can maintain a price by vendor And why do we maintain prices by vendor?

Because each vendor's price could be different for different kinds of services.

So we could maintain price lists by vendor and also we could maintain price lists by vendor and planned

combination, meaning the same vendor is going to supply a particular material in the Chicago plant

at a particular price and the San Francisco plant at a different price.

It's the same material or same service.

So these are the three different ways in which you can maintain prices for services.

The transaction codes for that are all under ServiceMaster.

Service service conditions.

These are the three different ways in which you can maintain the prices for services.

For a service.

For a service without plant.

And for service with plant and vendor.

Right.

And these are the different transaction codes.

Create change display.

And when you enter a PO and enter the service material in the PO for that line item, the prices are

automatically picked up.

Okay.

That completes the chapter on pricing.

So we'll move on to the exercises in the next chapter.
