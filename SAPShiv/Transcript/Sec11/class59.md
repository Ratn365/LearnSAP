 
Okay, so now we're going to learn how to create a service material.

Go to logistics.

Material management and go to ServiceMaster.

Service.

And AC zero three.

That's the transaction for ServiceMaster using the ServiceMaster.

We can create a service material.

No, this is very different from creating a raw material or a finished goods or an analog material.

Let's see how it's different.

So click on the new button, Click create new service.

And we're going to create an electric service.

So we're going to call it l e c.

So same name, say zero one and it's a service, right?

And the basic unit of measure is our we're going to measure services in hours.

Hit, enter.

And it says maintain a short text.

So we're going to give a basic description.

What shall we try?

We're calling it basic electrical services.

Hit enter.

And over here you can use evaluation.

Class of service.

Set 3200.

And hit enter.

Now that's all you need to create a service, master.

And go.

Hit.

Save.

Let's say we want to create additional services like the Advanced Service or the labor service.

It's really easy to do them.

Once again, go to service, Master.

And select the material that you have created already.

Click on copy and create.

Create the advanced service material.

So it's not basic, but this is advanced.

Advanced Electric Services and everything else remains the same.

The price is different, right?

So save that.

And.

Another one.

Now, this time we are going to create labor.

Neighbor zero one and call it.

Manual labor.

And the unit of measure is same valuation classes.

Same.

Save it.

So here is what we have done.

Using the ServiceMaster three.

We have created a basic electric service.

And the unit of measure is ours.

The valuation class is 3200.

And we have also created Advanced Electric Services and Labor using the copy button.

It's just an easy way to copy services.

Right.

So we have created this, we have created this and we have created this.

Now, now that we have created this service materials, let's go create a purchase order again.

Go to 21 N.

Same vendor.

4001.

And you don't put that material here.

Not in this field.

You just put a short text.

So what are we trying to do?

We are trying to procure electric services for a repair of our AC.

Right.

Or pump repair.

So call it pump.

Repair.

Right for a quantity of one.

We don't know how many hours.

We're just saying a quantity of one.

And account assignment.

Somebody has to eat the cost, right?

So we're going to put a cost center and put an admin department in charge for paying this.

Right.

And the net price is a.

$10.

That doesn't matter.

Just put a number there.

And now.

And now where do you put all the service materials that we have created?

Electric service, One basic electric service, Advanced Electric service, labor.

We don't put them here.

Instead, we put it at the line item level.

But in order to do that, we have to classify this material as a service material.

We just entered a text, right?

We didn't enter the material number here.

So how would we know that we are creating a service line item?

That is done using the item category D.

D is for service.

Hit Enter.

Now go to the services tab.

And enter your services here.

What are the services that we have created?

Electric service.

Zero one.

Right.

But you don't need to put a short text.

It will all be taken and put a quantity of one.

And now it's asking you for a price.

And we put.

And we say that the admin is eating the cost of this electric service.

We have just created one service here, so we are asking the vendor for 1000 won for an electric service.

Now we don't know that an advanced electric service is required or a labour is required.

We don't know that yet.

If we knew that in advance, we could very well put them here.

So as of now, we are expecting that we need one hour of electric service at $10 per hour.

Right.

So.
