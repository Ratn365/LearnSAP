 
All right.

It's time for summarizing what we have learned about services.

What are service materials as opposed to physical goods?

Services are rendered for your company.

By a vendor and examples of services are electric services, heating services, plumbing services or

baking services.

Any kind of service that is rendered for your company by a vendor as opposed to a physical delivery

of goods.

And those are created in the system as service materials.

And that's not done in zero one.

It's done in a different transaction called ServiceMaster.

Now services have to be accepted in the service entry sheet.

Well, the difference is physical goods can be stocked and anything that's paid for can be shown as

stock.

But services cannot be shown for.

So somebody in the right authority, like a supervisor or a manager, has to accept that service entry

sheet, which ensures that there is some level of oversight in terms of what we are paying for as a

service.

So every service entry sheet has to be accepted for physical goods like raw materials or non stock materials.

Prices are maintained in the purchase info record.

But for services, prices are maintained in three possible combinations, not in the purchase info record,

but using these transactions.

And we have seen three major differences in this picture of how you procure standard materials versus

services.

The first difference is that the item category has to be for services, and you almost always need a

cost center or any kind of cost element to capture the cost.

And you don't do a micro for service.

Instead, you do a service entry sheet and my go is automatically done behind the scenes for you.

And somebody always has to accept a service entry sheet.

But that's not the case in my go.

Nobody needs to accept it.

You just receive the goods against a PO.

The third major difference is during this invoice creation, a service based invoice is different from

a standard physical goods based invoice, and there is a check mark here at the line item level that

makes that line item in a PO relevant for service based invoice.

And when you check it on all the services that have been entered here ad hoc.

Like basic service, Advanced Service labor charges this and that.

They'll be defaulted.

Here and the person in the accounting department paying for the services.

Would understand what services were being performed at what price.

If that is not checked on.

This does not show the breakup.

It just shows one line item, the only line item that was created on the purchase order.
