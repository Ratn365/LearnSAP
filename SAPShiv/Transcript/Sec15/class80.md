So what do you want to do?

We want to create an RFQ first and then document the responses and compare the prices.

So three steps that we want to do here.

So the first step is issuing the RFQ to the vendors.

The second step is documenting the responses.

In the quotation.

And the third step is price comparison.

And of course, the final step being awarding that order to one of the vendors.

So let's do step number one now.

How do you do that?

Right.

Under logistics, material management, purchasing and RFQ.

Go to the first step request for quotation.

Simple, right?

Click on Create.

Now, by default, a n is selected a N for RFQ.

Just select that.

And because we are sending this out to so many different vendors, we want to put a deadline.

Just like how you apply for a university.

And they have deadlines, right?

So similarly, we're going to put a deadline.

A deadline to submit the quotations is say.

1031.

I'm just going to put a date.

And over here.

We use something called as a collective number.

Now we can make this not mandatory, but most of the time this is a really useful field.

So what's a collective number?

So each of these is a separate document.

For example, this document is 50000101.

This is

5000 0102 5000 0103.

And then you could be issuing these RFCs with ten vendors.

Each of these vendors would have a separate document.

101102103.

And when you want to do actions further, like document the quotation, do a price comparison.

You're basically going to work on all these documents.

And can you remember these documents?

So many of them.

That's crazy.

You can't.

So a collective number is basically a code that is linked or ties all these documents together.

You have ten documents that you have issued to vendors and you want to collectively work on them.

You just tag them as, let's say, with a number, or you could tag it with a text.

It really depends on what's really comfortable for the purchasing guy.

Say, for example.

We want to tag it as 2001.

So all these numbers.

Purchase requisitions will be tagged as 2001 and this 2001.

Is really a tag.

That binds all the RFCs together in one place, and that is called as a collective.

Number.

So remember, collective number is just a way to tag different RFCs together so that they can be managed

easily.

So what's our tag?

Our tag is 2001.

It's just a tag, remember?

Nothing more than that.

You could do something like this.

Also, A, B, C, D, Doesn't matter.

Anything is fine.

Okay.

So 2001.

Enter.

And here.

What do we need?

We need coffee beans, as usual.

Right.

And say we are asking for a quantity of 10,000 or 1000, whatever.

Right.

And when do we need them?

By.

That's also an important criteria, right?

Depending on the date, the prices might change.

So we need them.

On, say, November.

Right.

End of November.

Okay, Now we have created the RFC, basically the template.

Which is saying I need coffee beans.

Of £1,000 by such and such a date.

And please respond within 31st of October.

But who should it go to?

It should go to vendors.

Right?

4001, 4000, two 4003.

And we supply them here.

Click on vendor address and we say 4001.

Enter.

Enter.

Save it.

And the screen is going to remain right there.

It's not going to go back like typical screens.

Now you can put more vendors in there.

4000 to enter.

Save it.

Then you can also do 4003, 4004, as many vendors as you want.

Now we have decided that we are going to send it to three vendors, right?

So each of these three vendors get a separate document.

The content is going to be the same, but we are going to track them as separate RFCs.

See, one is 18.

Another is 17.

Another is 16.

But luckily for us, we don't have to remember all those documents.

I'll tell you how.

Because we use collective numbers.

So we go back.

And the creation step is done right.

So let's say we wait for a few days and then we get responses.

Responses could be via phone calls, via fax, via emails or whatever medium that we that the vendor

is comfortable with.

So this step is complete.

Step number one is done.

Now, step number two is to document the quotations that we receive and how do we do that?

In the RFQ quotation click on earlier, we clicked on request for quotation, so we created an RFQ.

Now we're going to document the responses that we get.

So click on quotation and click on Maintain.

Each of these vendors has been given a certain document number and we only need to document them in

the corresponding document number.

Right.

So the way to do that is a little tricky.

You'd have to search using the collective number.

There are many, many options here.

Now, if you click on this.

There are a variety of ways in which you can search for the RFCs, but go here.

Then select search by collective number.

Right that way it's much easier.

So go select a collective number of 2001.

That's the number.

That's the tag that we have given to the vendors to submit the RFQs.

Then click.

Okay.

And these are our RFCs.

16, 17.

18.

116 is with one vendor, 17 is with the second vendor, 18 is with the third vendor.

Say 16 is with vendor 4001 and he has offered to deliver £1,000 of coffee at say, 9.75 per pound.

Okay.

Save it.

No, say 17.

Is Vendor 4002 and he has offered us at nine.

.65 per pound.

Right.

Save and then of course.

Vendor 4003.

Has promised us at 8.95 per pound.

And save.

Now.

Now we have done step number two.

We have put the prizes in there.

And saved it.

And in order to pull down those RFQs.

We have used the collective number 21.

Now the third step is price comparison.

We need to compare the prices.

Between all the codes and pick the winner.

So go click on price comparison.

Then again, use collective number two.

2001.

Right.

There are different ways in which you can compare.

You can compare the minimum value.

You can compare by the mean value.

You can compare based on the discounts and list prices.

But we don't understand all those things yet.

So let's just do a basic comparison.

See SAP is comparing each of the vendors.

Based on the RFC numbers, and it's giving us the price that they're offering us.

It's just a comparison.

We can go to each of the individual documents and then compare it to yourself.

This is like a one big screen where it shows the comparison between all the vendors and it's ranking

them.

The first guy is 8.95 and the second guy is 965, and the third guy is offering at 9.75.

So it's ranking them so that you can make a better decision.

This looks pretty straightforward because there's just one product.

Now, if you do multiple products in the same RFQ, I need £100 of coffee, £100 of sugar, £100 of

this, £100 of that.

In that case, the comparison is not that straightforward, because for coffee, one vendor might be

better for sugar, another vendor might be better.

Right.

So in cases like that, the is comparison in one big screen is going to really help you make a decision.

And of course, till there is a lot of manual intervention required because there's a lot of judgment

that's required.

But nevertheless, the price comparison tool helps us make a decision in terms of which vendor is best.

And of course, finally, you're going to award this contract or order to one vendor.

The vendor that you think is the best.

And for the rest of the vendors, you send rejection letters.

Knowing the price comparison.

What we found is this guy is ranked one.

This guy is ranked two.

This guy is ranked three.

So 4003 is the preferred vendor because he is offering coffee at 8.95, which is the cheapest that we've

got so far.

So we.

Can create a contract with reference to that RFC.

And we need to tell these guys, the other vendors, that that we have gone with another vendor so we

don't need you anymore for this transaction.

So we're going to send them rejection letters.

So this guy.

So this vendor is accepted for this transaction and the two other vendors.

Or rejected.

For this transaction.

Now, this is just purely for the transaction.

We are not rejecting the vendors forever.

For this particular RFQ, we're going to send.

We're going to reject these vendors and accept one of the vendors.
