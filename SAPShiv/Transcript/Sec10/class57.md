 
Let's summarize what we have learned in this chapter.

We have seen what is valuation.

Valuation is how you value material.

And we have seen the different ways in which we value material and we have seen how the material type

affects the way the material is being valued.

The example that we have seen is raw material, material type A non-stock material, material type and

lag.

And we have seen the difference between the different types of valuation.

Moving average versus standard.

And we have also seen the formula SAP uses to calculate the moving average price.

We have seen how to create non stock items, non stock items, use material type and lag.

And we have seen how the creation of this material is different, how the accounting is different,

but logistically the rest of the procurement process remains the same.

And we have seen how to procure for stock versus consumption.

So.

When you procure for stock, the account assignment column is blank, and when you procure for consumption,

you got to specify who is consuming the particular stock.

So in our example, we have seen procurement against a cost center, meaning a particular department

is procuring the stock.

So and that's how the account assignment is used.

When you specify an account assignment of K in the header down below, you have to specify the actual

cost center because K is saying that some department is consuming the stock.

So K specifies that some department is consuming the stock and down at the line item level you have

to specify which department is consuming the stock.

And if more than one department is consuming the stock, then you can specify that marketing department

cost center is consuming.

80%.

An admin could be.

Consuming 20%.

Now, you could do it by you could do it by percentage.

You could also do it by value.
