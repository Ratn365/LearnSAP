 
Now, how about shared services?
Or shared goods.

Our services and we're going to talk about services in the next chapter.

But for now, how about shared goods?

Think about anything that's shared between different departments.

How about paper?

Let's say the HR department needs printing paper.

The finance department needs printing paper.

The marketing departments need printing paper.

So it doesn't make sense to order printing paper for each department.

Right?

Order them in bulk.

It's more cost efficient.

And when you order them in bulk, say 100 packs of paper, how do you distribute the costs?

The HR department, let's say, uses costs more and marketing departments use like less, say, 8020.

Right.

So there should be an easy way to distribute the costs.

Say the marketing department needs 80% and admin department needs 20%.

If you go to the account assignment and if you go to the distribution field, there's something called

distribute by percentage.

And you can put the different cost centers there.

Put a percentage.

The cost incurred for the procuring, the corresponding material will be shared correspondingly between

the respective departments.

So we have created one cost center, right?

Now let's create another cost center admin.

What's the transaction is zero one.

And instead of air put in admin.

Zero one and the reference cost center is zero one.

Where do we put a reference so that everything else is copied for us?

So admin is created.

And if you want to create finance.

Enter.

See.

All right, now let's go create a purchase order for something like paper.

Doesn't matter.

Whatever.

Non stock material.

In this case, I'm going to say stirrers.

See we are procuring thousands stirrers and Foota account assignment of K.

And what's the cost for it?

The cost is.

$10,000 at $10 per piece.

Well, that's an exaggerated amount.

Let's put.

$1 per piece.

So $1,000.

So 1000 quantity is $1,000.

Right.

So $1,000 needs to be distributed across, say, 80% goes to.

Distribution by percentage and say hit, enter.

H.

R01.

Go click on this tab and you should get that table.

So percentage wise.

Uh, we said 80% goes to air.

Right.

And then.

20%.

It goes to admin and then 20% goes to admin.

I'm going to we're going to divide it based on percentage and select distribution based on percentage

and say.

80% goes to air.

And 20% goes to admin.

Right.

You see the costs are being shared, the quantity is being shared.

Click save.

So the accounting is automatically done for you.

This is how you share costs for a common material that is procured in bulk.
