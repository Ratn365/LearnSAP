 
So far in configuration, we have covered master data.

We have covered vendor master material, master customization and info records.

Now we're going to move on to document types and item categories.

Document types and item categories.

When you create a purchase order or a contract or a scheduling agreement, any kind of document, that's

a purchasing document.

There are three key parameters that control how that item behaves, not just the entire document.

How that item behaves.

Think of this as the header.

And these are the line items, right?

So we have M0 one.

Or coffee beans or whatever materials.

Over here.

We have a little drop down.

Where you select the document type.

So this is item number one.

What does the document type tell you?

It talks about the overall business.

Process talks about the context in which we are doing that business.

Are we doing a stock transfer?

Are we doing a scheduling agreement?

A quotation.

A contract.

A.

So I'll write some examples here.

Are we doing a stock transfer order?

Are we doing a scheduling agreement?

Are we doing a quotation or are we doing a contract?

So on and so forth.

The second parameter is.

Item category.

What is an item category?

We have seen item categories for subcontracting.

We have seen item categories for surveys.

We have seen item categories for limits.

They control how that specific line item behaves.

So in the context of, say, a purchase order, a regular purchase order, one item could be a subcontracting

item, another item could be a service item, another item could be a limit item.

So the item category controls how the line item behaves.

So think of this as procurement type.

Again within the context of the document type.

So in the same document type, the document type sets the business process.

Overall business process.

And within that overall business process, the item category could differentiate one item from the other.

And number three is the account assignment.

What is the account assignment tell you?

Tells you who?

The item is procured for.

Is it procured against a cost center?

Is it procured against an asset?

So basically, who is eating the cost of this?

Right.

So these three things together.

Document type item category count assignment dictate how the line item behave.

It's the combination that dictates how the line item behaves, not just one of those.

And each of these has a specific purpose.

Like the document type dictates the business process or account assignment dictates who this is procured

for or who is eating the cost and item category dictates the procurement type.

These are the three main parameters in your control.

Meaning in the hands of the functional consultant to decide and model the business process that's required

for the business.

What do I mean by that?

Let me give you a very lay example.

Okay.

So this is America and this is San Francisco.

This is Chicago.

Right.

And then this is LA.

Okay.

And then within San Francisco, there are two cities, right?

San Francisco.

So knows it.

Now there are trains that run between all these different cities.

There is a train that goes between San Francisco to San Jose.

What's the distance here?

Probably 40 miles.

What kind of train goes there?

A small train.

And what does it have?

It has.

An engine.

And then a set of bogeys.

Right?

Think of the engine as the document type.

The item categories are the bogies.

Now, for a 40 mile run, there will be a certain set of parameters based on which you select what kind

of document type to use and what kind of item categories to use.

If you have seen these local trains, they will have two tiers.

Everything is sitting.

There is no sleeping.

And there is no pantry, there's no restrooms, nothing of that sort.

So those are the parameters for a local train.

Now how about the train that runs between San Francisco and l.a.

This is 300 or 400 miles.

In this case, the engine is going to be much bigger.

Much more powerful.

And the item categories.

The bogies.

The compartments.

Are going to be more elaborate.

They're going to have proper restrooms.

Maybe not a pantry.

They might be equipped with Wi-Fi.

And they might have a little sleeping compartment, if not at least a bigger seat or a bigger armchair.

And then there are trains that go between San Francisco and Chicago.

What is this, like 3000 miles?

And in this case.

The engine is very powerful.

Maybe 1 or 2 engines, I don't know.

And then the item categories are much more elaborate, right?

They have more facilities.

They have.

A pantry.

Now, in contrast to the local train, these item categories have pantries.

These item categories have restrooms.

These bogies have.

Slippers, meaning you can just comfortably lie down on the sleep.

It's a 3000 mile long journey.

So in this case of a business process or train, you don't allow certain things.

And in this kind of business process, you allow certain things.

Right.

And one more thing.

There are five different categories of purchasing documents.

It all starts with a purchase requisition.

Purchase requisition.

With reference to a purchase requisition.

What can you do?

You can create an RFQ.

And with reference to the RFQ, the vendors would have responded and.

Based on the vendor's reference you create.

A quotation, right?

This is the quotation process.

So you send this RFC out to the vendor.

The vendor responds with a quotation.

With reference to this quotation, you can create a purchase order.

And then with respect to the PR, you do a gr EIR and payment.

Now you can also do.

Appear with reference to the deck.

Right.

That's possible without the quotation process.

And then with reference to the purchase requisition you can do.

A scheduling agreement.

And with reference to the same purchase requisition, you can also do a contract.

Different kinds of contracts.

Quantity, contract value contract.

So on and so forth.

With reference to the scheduling agreement, of course.

You do a.

But with reference to a contract.

You do?

Release order.

Right.

Now, overall, how many different document types do we have?

Purchasing documents, not goods receipts or invoice receipts?

We have one purchase requisition.

To quotation.

Three.

Purchase Order.

Four.

Contracts.

Five.

Scheduling agreements.

So these are the five different document categories.

And if you see.

The one common document here is the purchase requisition.

You can create any document with reference to the purchase requisition.

Quotation scheduling agreement, contract purchase order.

Remember that?

And we're going to see how this is going to be configured when we come to document types in the next

chapter.
