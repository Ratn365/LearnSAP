 
You know, item increments.

Right.

What's an item increment?

An item increment we don't want anymore.

We only want import orders.

And.

4001.

Coffee beans, quantity, one, Â£1, one kilo or whatever this is item.

Item number.

And if you enter another material.

What's the item number increment here?

20.

So it's starting with ten and incrementing in quantities of ten, Ten.

20.

30.

40.

Why do you do that?

Why does he do it?

Why not?

One, two, three, four, five.

The reason is.

Let's do something like this.

Coffee Beans zero one.

You want to insert one more, right?

And say 15.

Right.

So 15 goes in between 10 and 20.

So this is a way in which SAP allows the user to insert items in between items that have already been

entered.

So between 10 and 20, you can insert another item.

Now, this is not the only way to enter line items.

You can start with one, two, three, four, five.

You don't need to start with 1020.

So let's create a new requirement saying item increments.

So start with 100, 200, 300.

Now, is there any specific reason why you want to do this for import orders?

Probably not.

There's no reason.

And it's rarely changed.

It's not that these things are changed all the time.

And whenever you create a new business process, you only have to do things like this.

You always have to create new number ranges not required.

There should be a reason why the business process would want it, and you might even question it.

Why do you want a new number range?

Why do you want only purchase requisitions of NB to be created with reference to this business process?

Why do you not require consignment and subcontracts from an import order?

They'll give you your answers.

Sometimes the business might not know and they're not all knowing.

They don't know everything.

Because you as a functional consultant might not know or do not know.

The business process as well as the user because they work on it inside out.

But your experience in configuring business processes across a wide range of domains is what comes in

handy.

And that's where you need to tell the users, hey, you know what?

These are the possibilities available in SAP.

Try to go for these business processes if it suits your requirements and if it does not.

And it's an absolute go go.

It's a requirement that has to be there.

Then, sure, we'll customize things for you.

But sometimes the users typically ask for the sky.

Oh, we wanted this way.

We wanted it that way.

Not everything is possible.

And there is always a bit of project management and change management that has to be done.

And we'll talk about that later.

But for now, the point I'm trying to drive across is look at the requirements.

And if the requirements are not really something that that is really required.

Ask them to not go for it.

Them meaning the users of the system when they give you that requirement.

Tell them this is not possible or this is not really required.

Do it this way.

For example, item number increments.

Do they really need them?

If not, let's not even bother about it.

But if they want, what you can do is go here.

Go click on Z and then instead of ten, you can do 100.

Right.

Save it.

Now.

Go create a new purchase requisition or a purchase order.

You want to save the document?

No.

Instead of NB.

Start with Z.

4001.

Right.

And then what is it?

Coffee beans.

Quantity.

One starts with 100.

Right.

And then the next item will be 200.

300, 400.

That's item increment.
