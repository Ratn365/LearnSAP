 you install the SAP GUI?

Your access provider will give you a dump of the SAP guy.

It's just a piece of software that you use to connect to SAP.

Think of it like a browser browser to the internet is what the sap gui is to sap.

Just open that folder.

Double click on it.

Go to this folder.

Go to GUI windows.

32.

Then click setup.

Click next.

For practicing Sapm.

All you need is the sap GUI.

Click next.

If you satisfied with the location, click next again.

And it's going to take a while and it should be done in like five minutes.

Close this.

And your sap guy is ready.

So the next step is you want to get connected to ASAP.

So it's like clicking your browser, opening it, and then typing in an address, right?

Like Gmail or whatever.

So the service that you want to connect to will be entered in the browser, right?

So similarly open the GUI and click on this new icon.

Click next.

This is the screen where you specify the address of the service or the server that you want to connect

to.

For example.

For example, I want to connect to an EC server, so just name it as EC and the application server is

the exact location that you want to connect to.

For example, if you want to connect to Gmail, you connect Mail.google.com.

Or if you want to connect to CNN, you say W ww dot CNN.com, right?

So if you want to connect to your SAP server, you can either use a domain or an IP address.

Example In my case, I'm going to connect to a domain EC six.

Dot domain.com.

This is just an example.

So your service provider is going to give you the exact IP address of the domain.

And you have to enter an instance number.

And that will be given by your provider.

The ID will also be given by your provider.

So you need to enter these three pieces.

ID number and an address.

Click next.

Next and finish.

This is the simplest way to connect to SAP.

So click on login.

You put your user ID here and you put your password here.

So that's my user ID and that's my password.

Hit enter or click the green check mark.

Okay, we are now logged on to SAP.

Think of it.

I don't want you to really understand everything about the SAP GUI at this point.

As we start doing transactions, we'll start know more about subtle things.

Think of it like a browser.

You move forward and backward in browser, right?

You move forward in SAP GUI using transactions.

If you want to go back, there's a back button.

The menu over here is very much like your Gmail list of links.

You go to Gmail.

And say click on circles anything with a hierarchical menu.

So under circles, I have my family, friends, acquaintances and following.

If you want to.

If you want to see my circle of friends, what do I do?

I go to circles, and then inside that I click on Friends.

Right.

Simple.

In the same way if you want to look at a transaction.

So this section here is called the menu path, and it's hierarchical, just like the way you have seen

circles in Gmail.

So if you want to execute a transaction, you got to first select what you're trying to do.

See if you want to create a purchase order.

If you want to look at your circle of friends, you go to circles and then friends, right?

So if you want to execute a purchase order, you want to go to logistics material management.

Then go to purchasing purchase order and then create.

So this is the transaction that you execute.

It's just that there are more levels of hierarchy, nothing different.

And don't worry about understanding all the levels right away.

It's just not possible.

You'll just see a pattern when you start doing things.

Now, if you go here, click on Extras and click on Settings, You'll see that each one of these transactions,

for example, vendor supplying plan known for creation of purchase order.

There is a technical name associated with it.

It's also called as a transaction code.

If you want to enable it, you go here and check on this option.

So this is how you enable transaction codes?

T codes.

So check on that, click okay.

And everything is going to collapse.

And you start expanding the menu.

Three.

And you're going to see the transaction codes.

You see the transaction code here.

M e 21 n.

So the transaction to execute purchase order creation is m e 21 n.

So this is an example of a transaction code or T code.

So if you want to create a purchase order, there are two ways to do it.

One is double click on this in the menu.

The system will start to create the purchase order.

You enter some details here.

Another way to do the same thing is to go to this field over here.

It's called the command field and enter the transaction code there.

What is the transaction code for this?

M A 21 N Right.

So this window is where you're going to enter the transaction code.

I'm going to enter m e 21 n here.

Put your cursor there.

Type in m e 21 n.

Hit.

Okay.

Same thing.

Right?

Yet again taken to the purchase order screen.

So two ways to execute a transaction, one via the menu path and another via the transaction code.

If you keep continuing to use the transaction again and again and again, you can drag the transaction

to the favorites section.

There are some other things that you need to know about the GUI, but we can learn about them as we

go through the rest of the classes.
