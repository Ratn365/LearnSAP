 
Now that you've picked the solution.

What is configuration?

Again, let's go back to the real estate example.

If you have picked a large house.

Then a large house has a certain set of templates.

Meaning.

The standard template says.

The master bedroom has a width.

Of say.

11ft by 16ft.

Right.

It has a certain height.

And it has a certain tile.

Maybe ceramic wood and so on.

And you want to customize it, right?

Your width needs to be different.

Your height needs to be different, and your tiles need to be different from what the standard template

dictates.

This is called customization.

ASAP provides you some options.

Right.

And then you customize it.

So in thinking in terms of SAP, the standard template says that a standard PO.

Right.

Has a certain number range.

It has a certain allowed item categories.

You know, item categories.

Right?

Things that dictate how the logistics should happen.

Stock has certain item categories, service has certain item categories and whether you can create it

with reference to a purchase requisition, so on and so forth.

And if your business requires that there needs to be two kinds of POS, you need to customize.

So there needs to be a customized PO where it has a new number range.

So PO type one has one number range and type two has a different number range.

And you don't want to allow services to be included in this purchase order.

Yes, you can do that.

So you restrict.

Certain item categories.

Right.

You can link new purchase requisitions.

This is example of customization.

Now the question is, what is your role?

You as an SAP consultant, what is your role?

ASCAP has provided all the blueprints, the templates.

Once again when mean templates, configuration configuration for purchase order configuration for configuration

for automatic configuration for movement types.

A broadly referring to them as templates or blueprints.

So ACB has provided them.

What is your role?

So your role as a functional consultant is to customize the product to suit the requirements of the

business.

And like I said, every business is different.

You could be working for Apple.

You could be working for Johnson and Johnson.

You could be working for Microsoft, P&G.

These are all different companies.

You could be working for Red Cross.

You could be working for Department of Defense.

You see, I'm picking a wide variety of industries.

Apple does what?

Consumer electronics.

J&J does what?

They do Fmcg fast moving consumer goods.

Microsoft Software.

P&G.

Something else.

Procter and Gamble, they do Fmcg as well.

Red Cross Red Cross can also implement SAP.

Red Cross is an enterprise, just that it's non profit.

Department of Defense.

It's also an enterprise working on public money and spending it on different national interests.

It's also an enterprise.

US military is also an enterprise.

You see US military the way it does business.

If you want to call it business is totally different from the way Apple or Johnson and Johnson works.

Right.

So your role as a functional consultant is to customize SAP to suit the requirement of the specific

business that wants to be implemented.

Coming back to the real estate example.

So when building a home, what are the things that you focus on?

You focus on things like.

You know, you start with a soil structure.

You start with the foundation?

You start with the municipal clearances?

I'm not going in any particular order, but I'm just trying to list out all the things that you have

to do, right?

You have to do water supply.

You have to do electric work.

You have to do drainage.

The way in which they should be sequenced, the way in which they should be.

Each of these sub projects is going to take time.

The staffing for the respective speciality is all taken care by project management.

There will be one or more than one, a team of project management, and they'll take care of all these

activities.

Now let's come back to SAP.

In the context of SAP, what are the different activities?

Requirements.

Change management.

Licenses.

Budgets.

And then workshops.

Blueprints.

Coding, testing, data, migration, debugging, and these are all the different activities that you

have to do.

In an escape project and the project manager will take care of implementing all these activities.

And who are required for these activities.

In the context of the house, a soil structure is being done by the soil engineer.

The foundation is being done by the structural engineer.

The municipal clearances are got by somebody in the project management team.

The water supply is taken care of by somebody.

Electrical engineer will take care of the electricity of the house.

The drainage is taken care of by a landscaping artist, let's say, and the interiors are taken care

by the designer, so on and so forth.

Right?

So in an SAP project similarly.

There is basis.

Who takes care of licensing and there is project manager who takes care of budgeting, change management.

And then there comes the consultant, there comes the consultant, there comes the fee consultant.

And if your company is implementing CRM or CRM, these are all the different specialties, like the

soil engineer, the structural engineer, electrical engineer.

And then there is the Abap team.

After that, the testing team comes in.

And then the training team comes in and then the data migration team comes in.

Each of these teams or people, individual persons take care of a specific requirement.

Like the soil engineer only does soil structure work.

He doesn't do water supply.

He doesn't do electricity.

Right.

Same way the consultant conducts only the sales relevant workshops.

You, the consultant does only the material master relevant workshops.

When you prepare the blueprints, the consultant will only prepare the relevant blueprints.

You will only do testing for relevant structures.

Relevant configuration.

Relevant customization.

Right.

You'll only interact with the Abap consultant on relevant coding or customization or user exits.

So everybody has a role to play.

So what is the point I'm trying to make?

The point I'm trying to make is understand the big picture.

If we focus just on Sbarro, learn your configuration.

It's like just exercising your biceps.

Yeah, your biceps need to be good, but your entire body needs to be well, right?

So you can't just focus on your own thing.

Of course that's what you're trying to learn.

But just understand the big picture.

You don't have to go into budgeting.

You don't have to go understand licensing, but understand that there are those things that are happening.

Because most of the time functional consultants move up.

Project managers.

Senior project managers.

Project directors.

You can even be a CIO.

So the game doesn't end with you just becoming a functional consultant in or SD.

And that's the end of it?

No.

Also don't go too deep into the configuration.

For example, the material master.

Has a total of, let's say, 20 views.

And each view has 20 fields.

That's a total of 400 fields.

And SAP.

Did not build it overnight.

It took years.

It took decades to build that screen.

Not just the first screen, but the entire material master.

So it has taken in requirements from hundreds and thousands of companies and compiled a structure for

the material master.

There are so many different fields in it and you don't need to understand all the different fields.

You don't have to.

You have to understand some of the important fields.

So if you try to go behind every field and try to understand the significance of it, you're just going

to go bankrupt in time.

Because it's going to take forever.

Everybody would have boarded a plane.

And if when boarding a plane, you always look to your left.

Right.

What's in the cockpit.

And the cockpit has so many different controls, so many switches, so many buttons.

If you're trying to be a pilot, would you go behind every control, every switch?

Not every switch is equal.

And that's why there are different sizes.

The throttle is the most important switch there.

It energizes the turbines.

And then there is fins and then there is wheels.

Right.

These are the most important controls and you've got to master them first.

And then there are smaller controls in the autopilot, like fuel direction radar.

So many different things.

I'm not saying that you are a complete pilot by just learning the most important controls.

But that's a start.

You can fly.

If you want to learn.

Learn or master the important controls first.

And like I said, if you go behind every control learning just the material master will take you six

months.

Because there are 400 fields.

How can you ever learn the material master in a month or two months?

So don't focus on all the controls.

Focus only on the most important controls.

Now, what are the most important controls?
