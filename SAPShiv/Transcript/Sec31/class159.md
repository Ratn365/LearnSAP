 
So let's summarize what we have learned in customization.

The first thing is.

We have taken the example of a house.

And then compared building a house with building an SAP system.

We have seen the different roles that all the different engineers play.

Soil engineers, this engineer.

That engineer.

Compare that with an SAP project.

We said there is going to be different kinds of consultants.

SD M Fico, Abap, CRM, CRM, Project Management, Data Migration Testing teams.

And then we have also seen why you need to customize.

What are the different choices that you have, like rapid deployment, solution, industry solutions,

plain vanilla systems?

So on and so forth.

Then we have seen the high level.

Customization.

Areas or we have said that 70% of the customization resides in three areas.

Account groups.

Number one.

Number two.

Document type item Categories.

Number three.

Condition Technique.

Between these three, you are covering 70% of all the configuration.

Now, some people might disagree with me on this.

But practically speaking, as far as I have learned in terms of the volume of transactions that you

do.

If you configure these three things, right?

You got a good framework for transactions.

Then after that, the things that you're going to do are very minute, really.

You know, things like entropy structure can be done in like ten minutes.

One hour.

That's it.

Of course, you got to understand why you're doing it, but that's all interlinked.

It's part of the big picture.

Again, nothing specific to.

So at a higher level, this is what you need for configuring areas like SDM.

The number three focus.

On business scenarios.

Don't focus too much on the individual pieces of configuration.

They all lead up to something.

The big picture.

So focus on the big picture.

Focus on the business scenarios.

How do I implement this scenario in how do I implement this procurement scenario?

How do I implement this kind of consumption based planning?

Once you start to focus on and tune your mind in such direction.

Then small pieces of configuration just become what they are.

They're just small bits and pieces that lend you to understand the big picture better.

Number four.

Not every control is the same.

Then I gave you an example of a Boeing cockpit, right?

I don't know.

There are a thousand controls there.

Switches, buttons, levers.

But what are the most important controls?

The typically follow the 8020 rule.

20% of the controls do 80% of the functionality of flying the plane.

Same example with SAP.

Focus on the most important fields and controls.

For example, I've given the example of the material master.

Don't go running behind all the 400 different fields in the material Master.

What they mean, the business scenarios behind them, so on and so forth.

It's just going to make your life hell.

Focus on the most commonly used fields.

And I'll be discussing them as part of this course anyway.

Just focus on them.

Once you have a very good understanding of them, then you can start to explore fields as it comes by

in your project.

For example, right on the very basic screen of Material Master, you have something like Document.

What's a document?

What's a drawing?

These are things that not all company needs.

In fact, 90% of the companies don't even use that.

But some companies do.

And that's the reason why that field is there in the Material Master basic view.

Do you need to worry about it?

Probably not, because, like I said, follow the 80 over 20 rule.

20% of the fields control 80% of the functionality for focus on the 20%.

Don't focus on the 80%.

That way you can set yourself a timeline and learn SAP easily.
