 
So in this section, we're going to talk about what is.

Configuration.

What is configuration?

So far.

We have seen bits and pieces of configuration.

What have we seen?

We have seen that movement type can be configured in OMG.

So somewhere in OMG you go in and configure things like what?

Like automatic procreation.

Value Updates.

Quantity Updates.

Consumption updates.

These are all things that we have seen already.

So what else have we configured?

We have configured split valuation.

What is split valuation?

If you want to split a material into different properties based on parameters like country of origin

and so on and so forth.

You configure split valuation?

So what have we done there?

We have created a country of origin as a characteristic.

And we have created some values for country of origin, and then we have tested it.

But so far.

We have never been deep into configuration.

We have just touched some aspects of configuration here and there, but we never took a deep dive into

configuration at any point.

So from this point on, we are going to be going deep into configuration.

Not just configuration, of course.

But along with that, we'll also be learning business processes.

But from this point on in the course, the focus is going to be configuration.

But what really is configuration?

You know, every company is different.

For example, GE.

Is different from a company on Wall Street.

A Ameritrade.

Right.

Both are two different entities and their line of business is totally different.

JP Morgan.

Works in a totally different way than, say, a transportation company.

So every company is different.

And SAP is implemented in many companies across a broad variety of industries.

So SAP is a software enterprise Software, of course.

Based on the requirements of thousands of companies.

So a transportation company can use a a finance company can use a SAP.

A manufacturing company can use SAP.

A services company can use a sap.

So SAP is built.

To cater to the requirements of thousands of companies.

To understand this.

Let me give you an example.

So think of SAP as a real estate builder, right?

They build homes.

So the builder has experience in building so many different.

Companies.

In the case of SAP or in the case of Builder, he has experienced building so many different kinds of

homes tall homes, small homes, big homes, cool homes, so many different kinds of homes.

But we all want our house to be different.

We have our own requirements.

We want a slightly smaller bathroom.

We want a slightly bigger balcony.

We want a slightly bigger lawn or a different kind of roof, different kind of shingles.

How different do you want your house from the Standard Builders implementation?

Defines how difficult your implementation is going to be.

For example, if a company is ready to go with the bare minimum requirements.

Right.

SAP has solutions out of the box.

They're called rds, r, d s RDS for rapid deployment solutions.

For example, SAP has built a solution for, say, is retail.

Which is a specific solution built for retail companies.

And if your company wants to go with the standard solution provided by SAP with minor variations.

Then you can go with a rapid deployment solution.

It's like saying, hey, you know what?

What are the models available with you, Mr. Builder?

And the builder comes up and says, you know, this is an example of a small home.

This is an example of a medium home.

This is an example of a large home.

This is an example of a mansion and mansion with a pool mansion without a pool.

He's going to give you some options.

And believe me, they are not some.

There are a lot of options available in SAP right out of the box.

And then you're going to pick one, right?

You want to mention you pick the mansion blueprint, you want a large house, you pick the large house

blueprint, large house with pool.

Sure.

Pick that and then slightly modify it.

You want to change the shingles on the roof?

Go change it.

You want to remove the pool?

Make it a lawn.

You can do that.

So this is called an RDS.

Rapid deployment solution.

Where?

The requirements are going to be slightly.

Different.

Slightly different.

From what?

From the standard blueprint.

If the company's requirements are slightly different from the standard blueprint or standard provided

by SAP you go with.

And then.

There is a standard solution.

You don't need ads.

You go with the standard solution whereby your requirements, your company requirements.

Are very widely different from the standard blueprint.

So there is a large variation.

From what?

Again, from the standard blueprint.

And then there are some instances where the standard blueprint or the standard EC system.

It does not even satisfy like 50% of the requirements.

In cases like that.

There are two options.

One is to check whether your industry, your domain is supported in a vertical by a.

So think of a sports star.

You know, some star basketball player.

He doesn't want a house like we do, right?

He wants to have a house in a speciality shape.

Like that of a basketball or like that of a baseball.

The builder is not used to it.

He doesn't know how to do it.

So in cases like that, definitely he still needs a builder.

It's not without a builder that he can build his house.

But that builder will have to do a whole lot of work because his standard blueprint does not fit the

bill.

So he has to work out of the way and create that those shapes and whatnot.

Create a new blueprint.

ET cetera.

ET cetera.

No.

The example in the industry is.

Think of retail companies the way retail does business is totally different from the way B2B does business.

Example.

If my coffee shop is selling coffees to the individual customers on the street, that's retail.

If I have coffee machines installed in the corporate companies and I go charge them and I go bill them,

at the end of the month, I go replenish the stock.

That's B2B because they don't pay me by the cup.

They pay me at the end of the month.

It's retroactive billing.

It's a totally different scenario.

It's B2B.

But retail is a totally different ballgame.

The way ERP is implemented in retail is entirely different than the way ERP is implemented in a non

retail scenario.

Now, same with domains like food and beverages, apparel and footwear.

I worked with one apparel and footwear company.

And the way apparel and footwear works, the way their material master is designed is totally different

than a standard material master.

They are worried about dimensions of the issue.

The width of the shoe, the length of the shoe, the color of the shoe, the seasonality of the sale,

stuff like that.

Retail is going to be worried about totally different things.

Food and beverages is going to be worried about totally different things.

Heavy engineering is going to be worried about totally different things.

Their priorities are different.

Services companies have different priorities.

So what SAP has done is SAP says, okay, we are going to build special versions of EC, keeping in

mind the requirements of these vertical domains.

For example, is.

Stands for industry solution.

And there are is retail is a apparel and footwear.

Food and beverages is heavy.

Engineering is services.

So these are called industry specific solutions and they cater to the specific requirement of that industry.

So if your industry is special and it has special requirements, then check if SAP has an industry specific

solution for your industry.

If yes, check if the satisfy your requirements.

Go pick that.

In most cases it does.

Right.

So this.

Is like a speciality blueprint.

And it's very, very, very, very different from the standard blueprint.

And finally.

We can have a company that doesn't fall into any of these categories.

The business is not so simple that it can follow an odds.

The business is not standard, so it cannot take a standard solution.

The business is in such a speciality domain that SAP does not have a vertical for it.

What do you do in that case?

In case you pick the nearest.

Possible solution.

If an industry solution fits it, go for it.

Most of the time, if the industry is so different, I'm not saying complex.

Nothing is complex.

If the solution is so different.

Pick the standard.

Right and start.

So this is huge variation.

From what?

The standard blueprint.

There is huge variation.

Then pick the standard and start to customize it.

It's not impossible.

Just that it's going to take time.

You can build anything in SAP.

The goal of the CIO.

Who's going to head any implementation is to make sure that the implementation is cheaper, takes less

time and causes less disruption.

But if your business is so complicated.

Then you got to bite the bullet.

Take the standard version of SEC or standard SAP system and start customizing it.

It's going to take years sometimes.

Believe me, there are instances where SAP is implemented for five years.

It's no longer the case.

People don't have that level of patience because in five years, businesses change.

But there are cases where it has been done.

Because the business is so complicated.

They are all around the globe.

It takes so long to do implementations.

But nevertheless, the point being.

If the business is complicated and does not have a solution for it, you will have to go pick the standard

vanilla sap and then start customizing it.
