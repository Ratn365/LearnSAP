 
Initially when you start to customize things.

The learning curve is going to be a little steep.

Your mind is going to throw tantrums.

It's going to say, Oh my God, it's too difficult.

I want to quit.

Maybe I want to learn something else.

Why does that happen?

This happens especially with functional areas.

I'm not saying that things like ABA because languages go incrementally.

Right.

If you want to learn the C language, you go incrementally.

You learn the basic operators, you learn how to write a file, you learn loops.

You learn things step by step.

You're not worried about the big picture.

Because when you learn a language, there is no big picture.

Your command of the language is what dictates how much you learn the language.

But with functional areas, it's always the functionality that you need to focus on.

And when you focus on the functionality, the configuration kind of drags you.

You wouldn't know how to implement a functionality.

For example, if you take the P2P cycle.

Where you have a PO.

You have a gr.

Then player, then payment.

For this to work.

How many things are needed.

Unless this works, you won't have the framework based on which you're going to learn further.

You cannot learn payment in isolation and not worry about how it works or GR works or works.

For example.

You have to create the right kind of master data.

Why?

Because if you don't have the right kind of master data, it's not going to work.

Right.

It's going to keep throwing so many errors that you're going to just give up.

So you're going to have the right vendor master.

The right material master.

And you got to have the right.

Document type.

Depending on what kind of transaction you are creating, you're going to choose the right document type

and then customize it the way you want it.

If you don't have that, your document is not going to behave exactly the same way that you want it

to behave.

And then you're going to have so much of configuration that you have to do.

What kind of partners are required in the transaction.

You need the vendor master, you need the purchaser.

You need the end user, you need the shipper.

These are all partners that can be part of the transaction.

And in cases like that, they've all got to be configured in the system.

And how do you issue outputs or messages?

You need to understand output, determination and how should texts be available?

You need to understand text determination.

How should you price the purchase order?

You need to understand pricing.

This is all configuration.

Number four.

How about other controls?

Like do you need custom movement types?

Depending on the type of transaction that you're doing, you might need custom movement types.

You might need vendor confirmation.

You might need to configure your tolerances.

You might need to configure custom number ranges.

These are like the bare minimum that you would have to configure an entire business process again from

payment.

And this is where you find that things are difficult.

Again.

What is the point?

Focus on the big picture.

Don't zoom in too much on the details.

Right.

There are so many things that have to be done as part of understanding the big picture.

But focus on the stones in the water.

Focus on the big picture, Focus on the scenery.

Don't focus too much on the paint.

It's just going to take your energy away.

I'm telling this from my experience because when I started learning SAP long back, I focused on the

details so much that I got so frustrated.

It took six months for me.

That's my first margin on SAP that I learned.

I did not like the experience, but I liked the ERP.

So it's just that my interest drove things.

But beyond that, if I had to do it again, I would do it totally differently.

I would not focus too much on smaller things.

Now, that being said, I'm not saying don't focus on these controls.

These controls are important.

They are what runs your business process?

I'm just saying that each control has a certain significance.

Don't focus too much on the insignificant controls.

Right now.

What are the most important controls?

We have discussed that in the previous section.

Right?

Like.

Account Groups.

Document Types.

Item Categories.

Condition.

On top of this, focus on the business scenario and always follow the 8020 rule.
