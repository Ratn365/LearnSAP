 
So we have created us zero one as a purchase org and now we want to assign them.

These entities have a particular kind of relationship.

Now this relationship is implicit.

The moment you create a warehouse, it's automatically assigned to a plant.

But we never did this assignment or this assignment.

We're going to do them now.

The first step is in enterprise structure.

We are done with the definition.

We now have to go to the assignment.

So go to enterprise structure, assignment, logistics general, and then assign plan to company code.

So close the definition section.

Go to assignment.

Go to logistics General and assign plan to company code.

So we have created a company called 3000 and created a plant, Chicago one.

Let's see if we can hook them up together.

Sometimes that entry would already have been made by SAP.

Why?

Because you copied instead of creating your own.

So before you go to new entries, just go to position and check if your plant is already connected.

So type in Chicago one hit.

Okay.

And I don't see any entries there, so go to new entries.

Type in S01.

That's the company code.

And plant is Chi one.

Hit enter.

And save.

As usual, go here and give a description saying assign company code US zero one to plant one and click

save.

Hit.

Okay.

All right, so this section is done.

The next thing is to assign a purchase order to a plant.

Now, a purchase order can be assigned in a variety of ways.

Don't worry about all the different variations of assigning a purchase order.

There are cross company purchases.

There are cross plant purchases.

There are many scenarios.

We'll get to it at a later point.

For now, just assign the purchase order to the plant.

Now, how do you do that?

As usual, under assignment.

Under material management.

Assign standard purchase organization to plant.

There are other things like reference, purchase organization and all that stuff.

Don't worry about it.

Go back.

Go back.

And go to material management.

So assign purchasing organization to plant, click on new entries and what's the purchase?

Org u.

S01 and the plant x one and click save.

Create your own request.

You are zero one to Chicago.

One save.

Okay.

So this assignment is done.

That's it.

That completes your basic enterprise structure.
