 
s purchase order again.

So go to 4001 hit Enter.

And try purchase or give A01.

Some purchase group and company code zero one.

All right.

Now that error is gone.

Okay.

What's the material that we want to enter?

BP 401.

Right.

So BP 401 is flour.

And we want to say 100 kilos or Â£100.

And then it says, enter a plant.

The plant is Chicago CSI One.

Oops.

We've got the same problem material not maintained for Plant Chicago one.

It's similar to the vendor problem.

Basically, like I said, all master data should be created for the respective org elements.

So if you are choosing.

Earlier we were using the material BP 401.

For the plant.

3100 and Company code 3000.

It worked fine.

The reason is somebody has created that material in the plant.

3100.

So anybody can create a transaction like a purchase order or a goods receipt in that plant.

Now we have created a new plant.

So this material either needs to be extended to the new plant or you need to create a new material.

So let's go ahead and create a new material.

How do you do that?

Close purchasing and under material management go to master data.

Material.

Create M0 one.

So this is a transaction again, you'll be using quite a lot.

So I want to create flower.

Flower.

You just want to tag it as a zero 1 or 0 two so that you can create so many different kinds of flowers

and choose an industry sector retail material type as a raw material because it's a raw material.

Click okay and select a basic data and purchasing data and accounting data.

Again, this might look like Greek and Latin at this point.

In the next set of videos, we're going to focus exclusively on master data.

Just click okay and select the plant.

Chicago.

Hit.

Okay.

It's just that these things are all tied up together.

Master data, enterprise structure, transactions, customizing.

You can't really do one without the other.

So I'm just pitching in by helping you here and there so that we can get started with executing the

transactions.

But as we go forward with customizing, we learn all the key pieces of the puzzle, and by the end of

the course you'll understand all the different kinds of errors and what we have to do to fix each of

those problems.

We're going to give it a name.

Flower.

The base unit of measure is, say, Pound and the material group is 015.

Doesn't matter.

And the purchasing group.

I'm going to say 300.

Enter and evaluation class is 3000.

And we're going to say moving average.

Enter.

And say yes.

Okay, material flower is created.

You can see that message in the left bottom corner.

Now let's go try and create a purchase order again.

Purchasing purchase order.

Create.

Go to Vendor 4001.

Enter a purchase order.

Zero one.

Company Code zero one and Material Flour zero one.

And the quantity of, say, 100 and where do you want to create it?

You know, you have to enter a plant on the right, right.

CHI1.

Let's see if it works.

There is an error, but that's not related to the material.

It says net price must be greater than zero.

Say put a price of $4 per pound.

That's it.

We're done.

Save it.
