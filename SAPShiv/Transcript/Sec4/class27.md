 
 locations.

So we have a plant in Chicago.

Then there are storage locations underneath that plant.

We have already seen examples of storage locations in some of the previous videos.

We said that we could be storing coffee beans in one storage location, bakery goods in one storage

location, raw materials in another storage location.

Or we could be storing all of them in a couple of suburbs, one in Naperville, one in Schaumburg,

one in Lincoln Park.

These are all examples of storage locations.

Think of storage location like a warehouse.

So we've got to create warehouses for this plant.

And how do you do that?

You go to material management all under enterprise structure.

And then click on Maintain storage locations.

Let's do it in SAP.

So you go back.

Close this and go to material management.

Click on Maintain storage location.

And what's the plan for which we want to maintain the storage location?

CHI1 right click.

Okay.

And who created the storage locations?

I did not.

Since they were copied from 3100.

These storage locations are automatically assigned to CSI one.

Now you can choose to let them remain.

Or I could delete some of them like delete these.

Select them and click on the delete button.

And then.

You could create some new entries like.

The.

For raw materials.

Like so.

And if you want to store coffee beans separately, you can say coffe for coffee beans.

And then for baked goods, you could have a name called Bake, give a description called Baked goods.

Right.

And each of them could also have an address like select that, and then you could click on the address

and you can actually maintain the physical address of the warehouse.

For now, it doesn't matter.

So click save.

And say that this is create.

Storage locations.

Raw coffee, beans and baked.

These are the three warehouses that we are creating for the plant.

Key one or Chicago plant.

Click.

Okay.

So we have created the storage locations and automatically assign them to the plant.

The process of creating the storage location automatically assigns it to a particular plant so you don't

have to assign it explicitly.

It's automatic.

So we have maintained three different storage locations.

And they're automatically assigned implicitly to the Chicago plant.
