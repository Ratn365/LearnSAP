Now we'll talk about split valuation.

What is split valuation?

We know that goods can be valued at a company code level or the plant level and below the plant.

You cannot have a unique value for a material meaning if you take coffee.

In the Chicago plant, say storage location, coffee.

You cannot have a separate value, say $11 per pound for coffee and $12 per pound in the raw material

storage location.

But consider this business scenario.

Say you're procuring coffee from three different countries or ten different countries.

Brazil.

Columbia.

India.

And typically each of these countries have a different type or grade of coffee.

But say we are only talking about one different grade.

Say dark roast Arabica.

And dark roast Arabica coffee can be procured from either of these countries.

And the average procurement price is dollar 11 here.

Dollar 12 Here.

Dollar.

13 Here.

And the customer.

Boys.

Just coffee or coffee beans?

So for him, dark roast Arabica is the same.

He doesn't bother if it's from Brazil or Colombia or India.

It's up to us.

The company, the coffee shop, to blend the coffee in such a way that it's most economical for us.

Not always the price.

There is also a question of customer satisfaction.

Maybe the Colombian coffee is better or maybe the Brazilian is more economical.

Maybe the Indian coffee has a blend of both.

In general.

If you maintain coffee as moving average price in the accounting view.

All these purchases.

So we have ten vendors in Brazil procuring at, say, 10.5 or $11.5 on an average.

Say we have ten vendors from Brazil procuring at $11 and 20 vendors here, one vendor here.

When you say moving, average price in the material is the same.

SAP averages out and then gives one moving average per plant.

But what if you want to have a different valuation in this case by country?

Country is just one example.

You could have valuation by season coffee after the rainy season in Brazil might be more flavorful,

so it's different.

And when you blend it with your dark roast Arabica general coffee beans.

It would be more beneficial if we had more Brazil coffee beans at the end of the rainy season.

The point being you want to internally maintain different valuations or unit prices.

Based on a variety of factors.

It could be season.

It could be country of origin.

It could be even flavor levels.

But still, it's one material coffee beans, zero one.

Let's say the customer views it as one material, but behind the scenes, you want to maintain different

valuations based on different criteria.

That way you know which one is more profitable or which one should go into the mix more than the other,

so on.

So this sort of valuating goods based on certain set of criteria.

Is not always required.

You know, this could better be done with having three different sets of coffee beans.

Uh, one for Brazil, one for coffee, one for India, and calling him Coffee Brazil zero one or coffee

Colombia, zero one.

On the flip side, this can cause more confusion to the user or the end user or the customer who is

purchasing it because, oh my God, so many different varieties.

And that's the reason why you keep it very simple for your end customer.

You just say Coffee zero one Dark Roast Arabica.

Which is a type of coffee.

And to get dark roast Arabica, you could have procured it from different countries.

You could procure it based on different seasons or flavor levels.

If you want that level of complexity based on how you procure or country of origin and so on.

You better be prepared for some overhead.

Because whenever you do this kind of split valuation or valuating materials based on certain characteristics,

any time you do a goods receipt, so you have plant and.

So you receive some goods.

Goods receipt.

Or you issue a goods goods issue or a check for stock.

When you do any of these things, you have to mention this characteristic.

For example, I want to receive a goods for Brazilian origin, dark roast Arabica.

So you can't just say coffee beans.

That's zero one.

You will have to also specify that characteristic.

So it adds that overhead because unless you specify that characteristic, you wouldn't know that it

has to evaluate this material at the Brazilian price.

So let's see this in action.
