The first thing that you have to do in configuration is activate.

So go to OAM w zero.

Okay.

You don't have to remember this.

By default, it's active.

If not, will have to go and say split valuation active.

If you don't want to remember the transaction code, you can go to SPRO.

Material management.

Go to valuation and account assignment.

And go to split valuation.

Activate split valuation so you can go here.

It's the same transaction code and you can activate split valuation.

Now the second step is configure split evaluation.

This is where you specify categories and types.

So what are categories and types?

These are the characteristics that I was talking about.

See, for example, Brazil, Colombia or India is the country of origin.

So that's one characteristic.

And like I said, depending on the type of business, you could have a number of characteristics.

So each of these characteristics are called categories.

And the values inside those categories, like, for example, country of origin has Brazil, Colombia

and India as values write different values.

They are called types.

Characteristics are called categories, and the different values for each of the characteristics is

called types.

So all you have to do is create a category and define different types under it.

And that's it.

So let's do this.

So go to global categories.

Now you can have global categories or categories specific to a plant.

Let's see that.

So go to global categories.

And these are the categories.

There are created already, you know, because this is an ideas system, you'll have certain categories.

And like I said, don't go overboard with categories.

If you go overboard with categories and types, it just makes life difficult for the user.

Because he has to always select this during goods receipt and goods issue.

Like I said.

But for now, let's go and create a category.

So A, B, C, D is taken.

So let's take E.

Hopefully EA is available.

EA.

And this is country of.

Origin.

Okay, Now, don't worry about these external procurement, mandatory in-house procurement mandatory.

It just basically says that, you know, you are restricting certain categories to be either externally

procured or internally procured.

Okay.

Okay.

So you got country.

Country of origin already created.

So save this guy.

Go back and go to global types.

And these are all the different types.

When I mean types, the different values for categories.

Okay.

Now I want to create some types here.

When mean types, these guys.

Brazil, Colombia, India.

So go to create.

And say Brazil.

Okay.

Create Brazil.

And the account category.

Is reference for raw materials.

So because coffee is raw materials, you have to do specify an account category.

If it's finished goods, you specify a different account category.

Point being you have to specify an account category reference.

Now.

Don't worry about account category reference at this point unless you understand account determination,

you will not be able to understand account category reference and unless you put a category reference

here, your account determination will not happen when you do a granular.

Okay.

All right.

See this guy?

And create another.

Create India.

Okay.

Save.

So this is Brazil.

And go create India.

Create.

Save.

And we also wanted to create a Colombia go back, click on Create Columbia.

I don't know if the spelling is right, but we don't care.

Save it.

We have created three types Brazil, Colombia.

India.

And we got to be able to assign.

The categories to types.

So go to global categories.

Select country of origin and select types to categories.

Okay.

And then activate the ones that you think are relevant for country of origin.

All you have to do is select that line and click activate.

C For country of origin, Brazil is active and.

There are 34 entries.

Right?

Where are the rest of them?

You'll have to do a page down for that.

Do a page down.

Right.

And then it's showing the second screen, Select India Activate.

And then I forgot that C is right after B, So select that.

Activate and save.

Right.

So we have created categories and assigned them types.
