 
Now, this is by no means an exhaustive list of transactions.

There could be more variations possible.

For example, we have not seen consignments.

We have not seen subcontracting.

We have not seen stock transfer orders.

We have not seen blanket pos.

Similarly, there are so many other concepts that we have not seen so far, but we have used them.

We have not seen pricing.

We have not seen document type customization.

We have not seen master data customization like vendor, master material master.

We have not seen source determination, partner determination, text determination, and we have not

seen the release procedure, vendor evaluation, vendor information version management.

So these are important topics that we are yet to see and these are all part of purchasing.

But we're going to stop purchasing here.

Under the next sections, we are going to focus on another major pillar of SAP.

It's called inventory management.

So let's start to focus on inventory management.

But not to worry.

We're going to get back to these topics in a later set of sections.
