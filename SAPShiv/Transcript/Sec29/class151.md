So let's complete the loop here.

So based on historic consumption, we have asked SAP to execute the forecast and predict future consumption.

And when it predicted future consumption, it also made entries in Md0 for ore stock requirement list.

But these are just requirements.

They are not being acted upon yet.

And requirements can be converted further into either purchase requirements or planned orders.

When you run.

So using Md0 three.

During the run.

The forecast values, depending on whether it's time yet or not, meaning January, now it's November

and for December, if you want to create a purchase order, the forecast will be converted or suggested

to be converted to a purchase requisition.

A purchase order.

December may be yes, Jan?

No, not yet.

They'll be kept in the stack and when it's time and when you run the next month, these will get activated.

Right.

So forecast basically gives you a prediction into the future in terms of requirements.

And any time you can run and convert those requirements into purchase requisitions or planned orders.
