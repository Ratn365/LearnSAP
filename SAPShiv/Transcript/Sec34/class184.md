What kind of customization is possible in info records?

There is very minimal customization.

One is number ranges.

So whenever you create an info record, a number will be generated, right?

You can specify what kind of number ranges should be used.

Well, what's the point in using different number ranges if there is only one type of info record?

Well, there are two types of info records, right?

One is info record.

For materials and another is info record.

For material groups.

For each of these, you can have either an internal number range or an external number range.

The second is screen layout.

This is similar to the field selection group that we have seen either in the material master or the

vendor master.

What can you do there?

You can go suppress fields.

You can go make fields as display, optional, mandatory, that kind of stuff.

And then you can customize the texts.

And of course you can mark for deletion or do any kind of mass maintenance.

But in terms of configuration, this is all you can do.

So let's go see what is possible in.

Espero.

Espero.

IMG.

Material management purchasing.

Purchasing info records.

Then we have number ranges like discussed.

There are two types of info records.

One is for stock materials, standard purchase info records.

Another is for non stock materials using material groups.

You can create a number range.

One external and one internal.

And you can create more, just like the way you did it in the material master.

You can't go and create or insert a new interval range here.

That's not possible because.

Or.

A purchase info record type, either standard or group based.

You can only have one internal and one external.

If you delete this, for example, let me delete this.

If you delete this.

Oops.

Now we should be able to go create an interval, right?

But there is no point in deleting it, so I'm not deleting anything.

You know what number ranges are, right?

Do you want to see the changes?

No.

And then we have screen layout.

This is where you create the layout for creation, change or display.

For example, if you want to do some changes in the creation screen.

So you go there and.

You start maintaining the different controls?

Like is it a required entry, is it an optional entry, so on and so forth.

Right now this is exactly similar to how we have seen the vendor master or the material master.

These are called field selection groups and each field selection group is associated to a set of fields.

Like, for example, basic data is associated with these fields and.

That particular field can be made either display or optional.

Right.

And you can keep moving through these different field selection groups and you can see all the different

fields that are available in that field selection group.

And that's all that's there in.

Purchasing for record.

There is texts, but we'll cover that in a later chapter.
