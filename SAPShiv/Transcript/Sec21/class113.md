Now I'm going to talk about how to split.

The goods received into multiple stock types.

And multiple warehouses or storage locations.

What do I mean by that?

Say there is the Chicago plant.

And it has two storage locations.

Coffee.

Raw materials.

The coffee storage location say, is completely full.

It doesn't have space.

The truck has come in with £100 or £1000.

Of coffee.

And where do you put the coffee?

Into the coffee storage location.

But it doesn't have space.

Maybe it only has space for, say, £100 or £200.

And what happens to the £900?

You can't ask the truck to go back.

Right, and come again tomorrow.

That's not fair.

He might do that.

But can we put the goods in the raw material storage location?

Temporarily?

Yes, the same delivery can be split.

In quantity across multiple storage locations.

How do you do that?

Again, in the interest of time, I've created a purchase order for £1,000 of coffee beans.

Save it.

And now let's go do a go.

My go.

Don't do a cancellation, instead do a goods receipt.

Goods receipt against PO.

Now, what do you want to do?

We only have space for £100 in the coffee storage location and £900 need to be put in the raw material

storage location.

So later we can pull it back from raw material to coffee storage location using a transfer posting if

they are nearby or stock transfer if they are far apart.

So the way to do this split is where this button distribute quantity.

Click on that button and then if you see this message, just say, okay.

And how do you want to distribute?

We want to distribute £100 of coffee.

Into the storage location.

Coffee.

That's how much space we have.

And £900.

Into the raw material storage location.

Hit.

Enter and click on Adopt.

That's it.

Click save.

And you see SAP has split it into two line items, one for 101 for 900.

And.

And the 100 quantity goes into the coffee storage location.

And the 900 quantity goes into the raw material storage location.

You can save it and always go and check back.

In Mbie to verify that the stock has really been posted accordingly.

Now, this is one way.

To split the stock.

Splitting the stock by storage location.

Some quantity here.

Some quantity there.

You can also split by stock type.

Again, in the interest of time, I have already created an order for a quantity of 1000.

Now go to my go.

Enter the purchase order number in there.

This purchase order is again for £1,000 of coffee.

Now we want to split.

Based on stock type.

So 100 quantity.

Goes into quality stock in storage, location, coffee and 900 quantity goes into unrestricted use for

storage, location.

Coffee.

Why do you want to do that?

Say, for example.

£1,000 of coffee is ten bags of coffee.

You've seen that, you know, there is a little bit of mold or some kind of deformation in one of the

bags that's say that is £100 of coffee.

The person receiving it into the warehouse is not sure if that is really good quality.

He can send it back.

That's an option.

But if he's not really sure, he might as well put it in quality.

Or somebody who is a coffee expert who comes in tomorrow morning to do a quality check can go do a quality

check, and if it's okay, puts it back into unrestricted use.

If not.

He can return it or put it in block stock.

And this is how you can distribute one line item into multiple stock types.

So 100 goes into quality, 900 goes into unrestricted.

Check and click.

Okay.

And click item.

Okay.

And save.

And like I said, I can go to IMDb and check for the stock.

You can do this as an exercise.
