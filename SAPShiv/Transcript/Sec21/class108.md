Now, let's say from first grade, we move the material to second grade and you can keep doing that

in a number of times, right?

And finally, if you think the coffee has become so stale that you can't really sell it, maybe it's

got mold or it's really unsellable.

What do you do?

You scrap it.

And when you scrap it, it's basically useless.

You just throw it away.

You just dump it.

And what do you do for that and how do you do that?

And you do that using a particular movement type.

So what movement type should be used for scrapping material?

Well, let's just see.

So we want to do a good show.

Yeah, and not against a cost center, but we want to do it, um, for scrapping.

Let's see.

It should be somewhere in 300 or 500, not 400.

So be somewhere in 500.

Withdrawal for scrapping.

Okay.

From unrestricted stock.

That sounds good.

551.

Right.

And we want to do it from the Chicago plant and coffee bean storage location.

And we want to withdraw what, we only withdraw coffee beans or one.

How much do you want to withdraw?

Maybe all £100 has gone stale.

Right.

Uh, now do a quick check, make sure everything is okay.

Okay, so when you scrap the material, there's got to be some department or.

Some cost center that should absorb the cost.

In this case, the cost center, I'm putting it as admin one, but typically businesses will have a

separate cost center dedicated for scrapping, so that will accumulate all the costs associated with

scrapping.

Right.

So check.

Make sure everything is okay and click save.

Okay.

Now, I want you to take a look at this material document.

54900849.

Copy.

Go back MB03.

That's how we view material documents enter.

And this is scrapping £100 of coffee because we know the material type is 551.

And let's look at the accounting documents.

Go to accounting document.

Just double click that entry and you'll see that the inventory.

Is credited or inventory went down by $118.

Which is the cost of £100 of coffee and.

The other account that's debited or added to is the raw material scrap account.

It's 40001.

So what happened here?

The inventory went down.

Went down by so much, £100.

And a scrap account or a raw material scrap account.

In this case, for finished materials, there could be another scrap account.

The scrap account went up.

So when you scrap goods, you use movement type 551.

I'm just putting all the movement types in these square brackets so that when you quickly look at the

screen, you understand all the different movement types.

Well, at least the ones that we are discussing here.

So when you scrap the goods, what happens?

The raw materials.

In this case, we're using coffee, so I'm calling it raw materials.

If you are scrapping finished goods, well, the finished goods material account goes down and correspondingly

the scrap account.

Goes up.

So that's the balance in terms of accounting that happens when you do scrapping.
