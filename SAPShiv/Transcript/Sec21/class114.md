Some materials.

Or more prone to quality issues.

For example.

Between coffee, flour and sugar.

Probably flour and sugar are more commodities.

You know, they have a consistent quality range.

But coffee has wide variations.

So when we are procuring these three materials, we want to make sure that coffee always goes through

a quality check.

Not so much for flour and sugar.

Well, you can do it.

But coffee has to go through a quality check.

How do you work on that?

Well, it's really simple in the material, Master.

There is a flag called post.

To inspection.

Stuck.

This is in the purchasing view.

Purchasing view.

Now, if you check this on.

Then every time during the goods receipt when the stock comes in from the vendor.

So SAP suggests that you put the stock in quality stock as opposed to unrestricted stock.

You can change this preference during the goods receipt manually, but by default.

Every year for this material asks you to put the stock in quality.

Let's do a simple purchase order.

We'll see this in action.

Document overview of we'll do it with the same vendor 4001

and for the same material.

Coffee beans.

Right and click save.

Copy the.

And when I do the micro.

What is the stock type that the system is suggesting?

We put the stock into unrestricted use.

This is the default.

Now, when you put it in there, the unrestricted stock goes up and you know what happens.

Now let's do that change in the material master M0 to.

Coffee beans and go to the purchasing view.

Click.

Okay.

And the plant is Chicago one.

And this is the flag that I was talking about.

Post two inspection stock.

If you check that flag on and save it the next time you create a purchase order and do a goods receipt,

the system suggests that you put the stock in quality.

Let's see that again.

Do another purchase order.

Copy the PO.

Now do, amigo.

Do you see the difference here?

The stock type has now changed to quality.

Now you can go manually change it.

No big deal.

But by default, the system suggests that you post this type of material, coffee beans in this case,

into quality stock so that somebody can inspect the stock and then after that, put it in unrestricted

stock.

Now for some kind of materials, say flour or sugar.

It could be possible that in some seasons the quality goes bad.

And on some seasons the quality is okay.

For example, when the rains start, the quality of coffee degrades.

So you want to really only check for quality issues in coffee in the rainy season?

Right.

You don't want to do it every time.

So you can check this flag on and off depending on the season.

Or.

There could be some scenarios where you don't want to always do quality, but only occasionally do quality

under certain conditions.

For example, say you placed an order for sugar with a totally new vendor.

Well, you have analyzed the quality and everything, but you want to make sure that particularly all

sugar from this vendor needs to go quality check, say maybe for a period of one week or one month.

Until you are absolutely sure that sugar from this vendor is okay.

Can you do that?

Well, when you create your.

Purchase order.

Let's take the same material.

If you go to the delivery tab, you see the stock type is defaulted to quality.

You know the reason why if you take another material, say New York Times, you want to inspect for

quality for a period of.

One week or one month because you're ordering this from a new vendor.

I'm just taking New York Times because I've got that material readily available.

But you can take any material coffee, sugar, anything.

Now if you go there.

Because we have not marked New York Times as relevant for quality in the Material Master.

The stock type by default goes to unrestricted use.

Just like how we have been doing now here, the person placing the purchase order can change it manually

to quality.

Now, if you save this order and then go to a goods receipt, obviously the suggestion to the warehouse

manager is to put the stock into quality as opposed to unrestricted use.

You see that?

Essentially it's a way for the person doing the purchase.

So essentially, this is a temporary way for the purchasing manager or somebody in purchasing to suggest

to the person receiving the goods that rather receive it in quality check for quality than just post

it into unrestricted stock.
