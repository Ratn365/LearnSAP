Now, the next obvious question is why will the physical inventory.

The inventory that's sitting in the stock in the warehouse be different?

From the book inventory.

Book inventory is what you go and see in.

And calculates it based on the inputs and outputs.

Inputs are what are being purchased or procured or manufactured.

Put in stock.

And outputs are what are being issued either to the vendors as returns or to customers as sales.

So if you have your.

Plant vendors get the goods in.

So that's called a goods receipt and customers are sent the goods out.

Customer needs coffee, so coffee is being sent out to the customer.

So that's a goods issue.

Well, there are many variations.

Customer could return the stock.

We could return the stock to the vendor or the plant could manufacture its own muffins, which are products

that are produced internally.

So that's also a good receipt.

Right.

This is goods receipt with the vendor.

This is goods receipt with the customer.

This is goods receipt internally on the assembly line.

Either way.

The sum of all goods receipts minus the sum of all goods issues.

Is a stock.

That's the count of the stock.

Right.

Very simple.

And SAP shows that to you in.

But physically, it's a different story.

Well, how, you might ask.

There are many anomalies that could happen that could result in the physical stock not being equal to

the book inventory.

For example, like we discussed theft.

Somebody could steal laptops, somebody could steal muffins or coffee beans.

I work in the coffee shop.

My friend comes in.

I could just give some freebies to my friends.

Many bad things could happen.

And second thing is human error.

Human error could be using of wrong quantity.

So when you do a goods receipt instead of 100, you post 1000.

Let's entering wrong quantity.

It's simple human error.

It could be intentional or it could be unintentional.

Or you could use a wrong movement type.

Or.

For example, instead of 101, you use 201.

One on one puts it in stock, 2 or 1 might not put it in stock.

It might consume it against a cost center.

Or if this is Amazon's warehouse, there is a TV.

And I broke it unintentionally, let's say.

Now, I don't want the company to know.

I just trash it somewhere in a bin.

Well, there are controls for that, but still.

That is also an example of a human error.

Right.

Because of any of these reasons, your physical inventory could be different from the book inventory.
