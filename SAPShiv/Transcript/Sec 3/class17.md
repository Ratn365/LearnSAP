 

The way to do that is where the transaction m m b e the transaction code is.

M m.

B e.

Where is it?

It's under inventory management.

So under logistics.

Material management.

Don't open up the purchasing section.

Instead, open the inventory management section.

So go to inventory management.

And under inventory management.

Go to environment stock and let's go there.

Go back and open up logistics, material management.

Inventory management.

Environment.

Stock.

And stock overview.

Now if you double click stock overview and type in MPP for zero one, hit Execute.

You'd see that this particular warehouse has a stock of 100,198 of this flour.

So in this case, it's kilos.

Now, how do you know that the 100 kilos that we have just received has been added to this lot?

Well, you really don't know.

A quick way to understand it is to create another order.

Again, note down these values and then try to come back again and refresh this transaction.

Let's do it.

Let's start all the way.

Create a purchase order.

Now.

It's going to be easy, right?

We know the drill.

Enter the vendor.

Enter the purchase order data.

Enter the material.

Let's put an odd number.

Say 150.

For the plant has 3100.

Put a quantity of 150.

And save the PO.

Note down this po.

Control C.

Go back.

Do a go.

Which is goods receipt control v enter.

We got our quantity of 150.

And we're going to get that into the second storage location.

Say 0002 because we have a stock of 100 in 0 002.

Now we are going to add 150 more.

That should make it 250.

Let's see if it does.

Check item.

Okay.

Click on check to make sure everything is okay.

And if yes, you can go ahead and save the transaction.

As soon as this document is saved, we can go back to me and click on this refresh button.

What should we expect to see?

We should expect to see this 100 being changed to 150 because we have just received 150 kilos of flour

and we have stored it in storage location.

0002.

Refresh.

And there you go to 50.

So this proves that we really did receive the goods and stored it in a particular storage location of

the Chicago plant.

So that was where you just entered the material.

Execute.

Then it shows you how much stock we have in each of the plants and the respective storage locations.

So what have we just done?

In the previous video, we have created a purchase order, sent it to the vendor.

In this video, the vendor has sent us the goods in a truck.

And what we have done is we have recorded that, we have received the goods and we have also verified

that we indeed have the goods in a particular storage location of the plant.

And we have done that using the transaction may go or I go.
