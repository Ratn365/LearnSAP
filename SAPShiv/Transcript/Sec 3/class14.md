That concludes our video on how to create a purchase order in SAP.

Let's do a simple exercise.

I have a couple of questions here.

The first question being.

Give some examples of the search criteria to select vendor during creation.

Remember when we created the PO, we have selected a vendor, right?

And we have chosen Chicago as a search criteria.

Now this question is asking you what other search criteria do you have when you select the vendor?

Second question is, what is the org data that's entered in the.

We rented something like purchase.

Org purchase group.

This question is asking you to list whatever you have entered in the purchase.

Org data.

The third question is.

Can you enter a zero quantity at the line item level?

You know, we have entered a quantity of 100 or 10 for flour, Right.

Can you enter zero?

If yes, what does it really mean?

The fourth question is what is the material number for hard wheat flour?

So it's basically asking you to search for hard wheat flour and then give the material number.

The fifth question is, so when you enter hard wheat flour, whatever that material number is in plant

3100.

It gives you an error message.

So this question is asking you what is the error message that you get?

The sixth question is use 3200 plant for this material and enter a price of $2 per pound.

And see what happens.
