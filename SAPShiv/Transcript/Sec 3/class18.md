  order.

So this link.

Here is very important.

And anybody at any point in time can go back and see the reference linkage between the purchase order

and the goods receipt.

How do you see that?

You go to the purchase order and see that there is an extra tab here called the purchase order history,

which is basically a history of all the transactions that have happened against this PO.

Well, not all transactions, but goods receipts and invoice receipts that we are going to see in the

next chapter.

So let's go and see if our purchase orders have these transactions recorded.

Go back.

Go back.

Go back to purchasing.

Purchase order.

Change or display because we don't want to create it.

The last created purchase order will automatically be pulled up.

And go to the purchase order history tab.

Now this tab will not be available if you did not do any kind of subsequent transaction like a goods

receipt, for example.

But if you have done a good receipt, this tab will automatically be added.

And you can see the goods receipt that has been made against this PO.

If you want, you can even just click on that and the system will take you to the transaction that you

have created.

See, this is the 150 quantity that we have just received and we have received it in the warehouse.

0002.

Right.

You can go back and then you'll see the pile right there.

All right.

So that was the link between the purchase order and goods receipt.

All right.

We have another exercise here.

So the first question is, what is a transaction code to create a goods receipt?

This one is really simple.

The second question is list all the storage locations associated with the planned 3100.

You can do it in a couple of ways and I'll show you in the solutions.

Third question Do you have to enter quantity in my.

This one was a little tricky.

Try it out.

Number four, what is the error message you get when you save my go without flagging the item is okay.

Number five.

Can you receive more quantity than ordered in the PO?

Meaning if we have ordered for a quantity of 150, can we receive 160 when the vendor just sends it

over?

Number six.

What's the transaction code?

To check the stock level.
