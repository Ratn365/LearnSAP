So these are reservations now.

What is the point in documenting reservations?

If somebody needs £100 of coffee.

I want to reserve it here.

What is the point in creating these reservations?

Why are we doing these reservations?

The reason why we are doing a reservation manually is to document that there is a requirement.

Okay.

So there is a requirement for Jan 31st and that was created on Jan first.

Now why are we documenting that reservation?

How is it going to help anybody?

Now to get £100 of coffee.

In this case, we have just done a good issue for two materials.

Coffee beans or one.

Coffee beans or two.

Well, we could do a good show because we had goods in stock.

If you don't have goods, how are you going to plan how much you need?

So the primary purpose of reservation is to document the requirements so that somebody who is responsible

for planning that material can procure or manufacture that amount of goods.

This is the sole and whole reason why you create a reservation.

A reservation is created.

So because you want to tell the person who is planning that particular material to either procure it

or produce it.

It's his problem.

His headache.

You don't care.

All you're saying is I need £100 of coffee by this date.

So how does this person what I'm talking about, who is responsible for planning that material, know

that you have created a reservation.

Let's go create reservation.

Save for coffee beans.

And I'm going to give a weird number.

Let's say 113.

The reason why I'm doing a weird number is because.

I want you to see that number when I show you the reservation list.

Go save it.

And six, six, nine, one eight.

That's the reservation number.

Now, the person responsible for planning the coffee beans zero one will go to zero four.

Puts the material in their.

Coffee beans.

And hit enter.

Now, in the later set of chapters, when we go to MRP, you'll understand what I mean by requirements,

how to work on requirements.

So for now, think of this as a list of requirements.

How we act on it is not something that we're going to worry about.

This is the list of requirements.

There you go.

You got so many of them here, right?

And this column over here tells you what kind of requirement it is.

Is it a requirement from a purchase order?

Is it a requirement from a purchase requisition?

Is it a requirement from a sales order?

Is it a requirement from a production order?

So on and so forth.

If you let see, scroll all the way down.

And you see that there is a reservation that we have just created.

11 one 2016.

October 1st, 2016 and 66918 and you see the quantity is 4113.

Right.

You can just go double click this and view that reservation.

So this is the reservation number.

Click on the glasses.

And this is your reservation.

You can go to material.

What material, what line item, blah, blah, blah.

Click on that and you'll see the line items.

In that reservation.

Okay.

Yeah.

What movement type is used?

Has it been deleted?

What is the quantity?

What is the unit of measure?

So on and so forth.

So like I said, requirements like these.

Keep getting accumulated in the stock.

Requirement.

Missed.

Transaction.

It's just a list that you can pull using the transaction md0 for.

Zero for not just lists the reservations.

It lists all the requirements.

It lists the requirements coming from sales orders.

It lists requirements coming from production orders, it lists requirements coming from projects, so

on and so forth.

Reservations happened to be just one of them.

And like I said, requirements for sales orders, production orders, projects are typically created

automatically.

So that reservation is created automatically.

So these are examples of automatic.

Requirements.

And you cannot change automatic requirements.

You cannot go to zero four or you cannot go to 22 and change.

So this is.

NB 21.

This is how you create a manual reservation.

Anything that you create here, an MV 21, of course can be changed in MV 22.

Because it's a reservation that was created manually.

So these automatic reservations.

That come in the form of requirements from these upstream orders cannot be changed.

So these cannot be changed.

When mean these cannot be changed in 22.

Meaning a customer has asked for £100 of coffee in a sales order.

It has created a requirement in Md0.

For now you cannot go to Md0 for select the line item, pick up that requirement, go to RM 22 and change

the requirement.

That's not possible.

Any requirement that's triggered from a source document like a sales order or a production order can

only be changed in the source document.

Meaning if the customer asks for 100 points of coffee.

You can go to the sales order and change the requirement to 51, 50, whatever you want, and you can

automatically see that change in md0 for.

Again, the key takeaway from this screen is.

Any reservation that's created manually.

Can be changed, but any reservation that's created automatically using source documents like sales

order, production order or projects cannot be changed in md0 for.

And what is zero four?

Zero four is the stock requirement list, where all the requirements for stock of a particular material

in a particular plant.

Is displayed by SAP and actions can be taken based off of that.

And we are going to talk more about Md0 four and stock requirement risk.

When we come to.

But until that point, just understand that all the requirements and reservations come sit in md0 for.

For the planner to take actions.
