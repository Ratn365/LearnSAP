In this section we will talk about.

Reservations.

What are reservations?

You go book a ticket to fly from San Francisco to LA.

That's a reservation.

You go to a spa, you make a reservation in advance, right?

So reservation is just what it is.

So in the context of inventory management.

If I say.

I need.

£100.

Of coffee from Chicago plant.

On.

Jan 10th.

This is what the quantity is.

This is what the material is that we want.

And this is from which plant?

We need the material from and this is which date we need it by.

Now, these are the parameters that we are very comfortable with quantity, material, plant and date.

Now this I.

Who is I?

In the context of inventory management.

This could represent anybody in the company.

When I mean anybody, any entity or even a person who needs goods.

On a particular date.

For example, let me qualify some of these entities.

Say there is an employee in our coffee shop who wants to buy coffee from us.

Right.

So an employee.

Could be an example of somebody who represents demand for coffee.

Say there is a customer.

Who places an order when a customer places order.

It is called a sales order.

Say there is a birthday party and we know the birthday party in our case is represented using a project.

Say, for example, the baker is baking a cake and he needs to sprinkle coffee on it.

So coffee is one of the raw materials required to bake a cake, let's say.

So.

The baker.

Baking the cake creates a production order.

So these are all examples of requirements that need materials, production orders, projects, sales

orders, employees, cost centers, any of these entities.

Now when a customer creates a sales order.

Do I have to go and create a reservation?

Say the customer asks for £100 of coffee.

Do I have to manually go and create a reservation?

Not really, no.

You don't have to.

Or in the case of a production order, the Baker.

Needs to bake a cake.

The recipe for coffee cake needs ground coffee.

And he did not explicitly go and make a reservation for, say, £1 of coffee.

Wherever the demand is procedural, you don't need to go manually create reservations.

The system SAP will automatically create a reservation when you create a sales order.

The system will automatically create a reservation for the required raw materials when you create a

production order.

Now an employee asking for something like coffee is an ad hoc scenario.

So that requires a manual reservation.

So wherever things are ad hoc.

Things are not planned.

In that case, you can do a manual reservation.

And in the context of reservations, we typically only talk about manual reservations.

Automatic reservations are always taken care by the source documents.

When I mean source documents, sales order, production order, anything of that sort and all ad hoc

requirements could be taken care of by reservation.

So let's go create.
