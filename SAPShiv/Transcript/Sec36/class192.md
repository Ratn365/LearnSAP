 
So what are text items?

Text items.

Text items are used to create dummy polls.

So whenever you think of text items, think of dummy polls.

Why do you create a dummy?

Many reasons.

Again, this is a very outlier case.

It's not a standard scenario like the blank item category.

It's very rare to use it.

But there are cases where they are used.

Example, if you want to create a PO and then just print it, do nothing else.

To show somebody that there is a peer that was created.

So there's a pool that's created.

You can print it, but you cannot do anything else apart from it.

What do I mean by anything else?

You can do a goods receipt, meaning you can't receive goods, you can't receive invoices, you can't

do any of the standard stuff that you do in a typical.

So you can go create a new PO like so.

Do you want to save it?

No.

4001.

Put the item category as t.

And then enter some material, text and some quantity.

And it doesn't matter what you enter.

I can't.

Clicking right here on the field.

I'm not able to enter anything because I can't enter anything.

The system does not allow me to enter it.

Right now, I can save it and issue an output.

Print it on paper or create a PDF.

Now.

Is it relevant for delivery?

See, it's not relevant for delivery.

If it were relevant for delivery, there would have been.

Edgier checkmark.

Like, for example, if I say coffee beans.

Oh one.

Quantity of one.

£1.

Right.

And if I go to line item 20.

You see there is a delivery tab and then there is a goods receipt tab.

Right.

For 20 standard item.

Goods receipt is required, but for ten.

The delivery tab does not have a goods receipt checked on.

That means you can't really do a goods receipt.

If I save this.

Right.

Copy that.

Like so.

Go to my go.

Try to do a goods receipt.

Only one item is allowed here, which is the line item that has a standard item category.

The text item category does not even show up as a line item because it's not relevant for delivery.

So my go looks at the line items in the PO and says okay, first line item is text not relevant for

delivery?

I am not even going to put that or allow it here in my go.

The second line item is coffee.

Okay, that's relevant for delivery.

Okay, let's do a delivery or a goods receipt against it.

Right.

Same thing with the invoice.

It's not relevant for invoice.

So once again, why are item categories.

Text items used?

The item category is.

The four texts it's used to create dummy pose and.

Not relevant for GR or R.

Right.

Now, some of you might have a question here.

All right.

It's not relevant for Grier.

It's just a po.

Nothing else can be done on top of it.

So why don't we create a standard PO document type and be.

And line item ten.

Standard item category.

Put some text.

Right and not do anything on it.

Meaning don't print it if you want, you can print it.

Don't do any goods receipt.

Don't do any invoice receipt.

How different is that from using a text item category?

Very different.

Why?

Say, for example, you create a standard purchase order 4001 and using standard item category, you

say coffee beans or whatever quantity one and not do any action on it.

Like don't do a goods receipt or don't do an invoice receipt.

The system will deem this as goods receipt relevant and invoice receipt relevant.

Right.

Because it's a standard item category.

If it were text, it would have been a different case.

Because it's a standard item category.

The system deems it as irrelevant.

And gear goods receipt relevant?

You have seen that in the purchase order delivery tab and invoice tab.

Right.

If you go to line item 20, this is the check mark that says that that item is relevant for goods receipt.

So a goods receipt has to happen.

And if you go to the invoice tab, this is the check mark that says that the item is relevant for invoice

receipt, meaning the invoice receipt has to have.

What if you don't do any of these steps?

Like you don't do an invoice receipt.

Don't do a goods receipt.

Is it equivalent to text item?

Not really, because once they are set as or marked as relevant, if the goods receipt and the invoice

receipt does not happen, it will basically show as outstanding from the vendor.

So this basically creates an outstanding oh, I'm yet to receive goods from this vendor.

Quantity of 100 coffee beans, 100 points of coffee beans.

I'm yet to receive invoice from this vendor.

An invoice of, say, $1,000.

But if you use text items, it will not create that outstanding.

So.

And why is this outstanding important?

What if it creates an outstanding What difference does it make?

The difference is.

One of the main differences is reporting.

If you want to find out all the outstanding invoices from a vendor that we are yet to receive.

This will come up, right?

This line item will come up.

But if the intention is to just leave it at that and not do anything, then this will always pop up.

Which you don't want, really, right.

The intention is to actually look at invoices that are really receivable, not dummy ones.

So if you really want a dummy or a dummy line item in the PO, always use texts or text items.

Another reason why you want to use text items and not standard items is vendor.

Performance.

If the vendor says that he is going to deliver £100 of coffee in five days, and if it's seen as an

open item, it affects vendor performance.

If the vendor is not delivering it for ten days, 100 days, 1000 days, it affects the vendor performance.

Vendor performance is something that we have not seen yet.

So when we come to vendor evaluation, we'll see what is vendor performance, how to compare different

vendors.

ET cetera.

ET cetera.

But the point I'm trying to make is.

When you create outstanding receivables like invoices, goods, receipt from a vendor, it affects the

vendor performance in reporting.

And also it causes confusion.

Or we are yet to receive so much goods from this vendor.

Oh, my God.

Do we really need to receive it?

If yes, that's a different story.

If not, if the intention is not to create a receivable item, then create it as dummy.

Right.

So this is item category text.

Now, if you go to item category text, where is item category text?

Text.

Material cannot be entered.

Account assignment cannot be entered, nor can you do inventory management.

You can't do any of that stuff.

And if you look at goods receipt and invoice receipt, these are the indicators that flow down to the

line item level.

These indicators, and that is based again on the item category.

So for text, both these indicators are checked off.

Meaning?

Those indicators are not relevant.

Meaning?

When you create a text item that is not relevant for delivery, nor is it relevant for invoice.

And you can't enter a material, you can't enter an account assignment because it's a dummy item.

Nobody can eat that cost and inventory is not allowed because it's a dummy item.

You're not going to do goods receipt.

So what's the point in doing inventory management?

So this is text items.
