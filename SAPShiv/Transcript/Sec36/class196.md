 
Next we have item category subcontracting.

The item category is L for subcontracting.

Let's go over the business process.

What happens?

You issue a PO to the vendor to produce a certain material.

Right and to produce that material.

You send the raw materials as well.

And finally the vendor produces it in his factory.

And finally sends back the finished product.

So this is finished.

This is raw materials and.

Excess raw materials, if any, are returned to the plant.

This is the subcontracting, right?

So you supply raw materials and the vendor gives us the finished product.

The example we have taken is the wedding cake.

Assuming we don't have expertise to make the wedding cake in our bakery.

If a customer asks for a wedding cake.

We are going to ship all the raw materials to a specialized vendor.

Who specializes in making wedding cakes, and he's going to return it to us.

The wedding cake, finished product and any other excess raw material that was not used is going to

be returned back to us.

Another example that we have taken is the turbine.

So GE Aeronautics needs a turbine.

The turbine is milled out of a single block of aluminum or steel.

And let's say it's a special material.

We send the entire block of aluminum to the vendor.

The vendor does a job milling and whatnot.

He produces the fin or the turbine part sends it back to us.

Right now.

What are the properties of this?

So do you need a material?

Yes.

Material is required.

Now.

Can you do an account assignment?

Yes.

Account assignment is possible, right?

Think of scenarios like there is a cost center.

Say the cost center.

Needs something to be subcontracted.

Imagine that wedding cake to be required by the HR department because somebody in the HR department

is getting married and the company wants to gift that wedding cake internally.

Or.

Take the case of GE.

There is an internal project going on and that project requires some goods to be subcontracted.

That is possible using a count assignment so something in the company can eat the cost of that subcontracted

material directly.

Right.

That's the reason why account assignment is possible.

Now, how about inventory management?

Is it possible?

Yes, inventory management is possible because it's our goods.

Right.

It's our stuff that we are delivering as raw material, and when it comes back as finished product,

it's a purchase.

So it becomes our product.

So inventory management is definitely possible, right?

Now.

Do you receive an invoice?

Yes.

We receive an invoice.

We can do a goods receipt.

We can also do an invoice receipt.

Right.

So goods receipt, possible invoice receipt, possible inventory management, possible account assignment.

Possible material could be required or need not be required.

Right.

So you see that material is possible.

It doesn't say mandatory.

See why?

Because in case of consumption, you don't need to specify that material.

Typically when consumption is possible, material is also possible.

Right.

Because when consumption is possible, that means there is a cost center eating the cost of that material

and when it is consumed.

At goods receipt.

You don't need to really create a material or require a material.

You can do it just by specifying a text and putting an account assignment category.

Right.

So material is required, account assignment is possible and inventory management is possible.

Goods receipt is possible.

Invoice receipt is possible.

Right.

Do you see that material is required?

Account assignment.

Possible inventory management.

Possible invoice.

Possible goods receipt possible.

This is subcontracting.
