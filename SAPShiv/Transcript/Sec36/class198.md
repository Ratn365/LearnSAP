 
Now let's summarize what we have learned about item categories.

The controls behind an item category are unchangeable, meaning you cannot configure them.

You can only change the external nomenclature.

If K is consignment, you can call it Z, no problem.

But you cannot change the controls behind it.

And what are the controls behind an item category?

There are 6 or 7 different controls.

And what is the point in learning these controls if you can't change them?

Right?

After all, we as functional consultants are supposed to configure things, but item category in case

of purchasing is more or less an exception.

Because the variations are really limited.

You can't really go beyond a certain number of item categories and they are limited.

You can't create more item categories.

You can create more account assignments, but not item categories.

The reason why we are learning about item categories, even though they are not changeable, is because

we can understand a whole lot about the business process by looking at the item category.

Why is an item behaving in a certain way?

Is controlled by the controls behind that item category.

So business process, along with the item category mostly dictate how that item is behaving.

For example, t text items.

This is an item category that's used to create dummy polls and we have talked about what a dummy is,

why to use text versus standard item categories, what are the controls behind texts, so on and so

forth.

And then we have talked about material unknown.

A special item, Category M is used when you don't know the material that you're going to order or that

you're going to negotiate for.

Example is coffee.

We want to negotiate a contract with the vendor for all coffee beans for a huge sum of money.

The vendor is typically ready to give us a discount.

But you don't know for which material you're going to apply that discount.

It's going to apply across the board.

So in cases like that where you don't know what kind of material you're going to use, use item category.

Right.

Same is the case with another item category called Material Group.

So you can use both of them any either way you want.

Material unknown or material group.

Both are very similar and play a similar role.

Next we talked about third party item category.

This is a scenario that requires integration with PSD and.

Since we are not going to learn in this course.

A kind of brief Dover.

The creation of sales order.

And how sales order triggers a purchase requisition.

And the purchase requisition is converted to a purchase order.

And in the purchase order because the source is the sales order a customer.

The item category is third party.

And what it essentially says is, Hey, vendor, don't deliver the goods to my plant.

Deliver it directly to the customer.

That's why it's called third party, because the vendor delivers the goods directly to a third party.

The customer in our case, not the plant.

And then we have talked about material groups.

Like I said, material unknown material groups both play a very similar role.

And then we talked about consignment.

We talked about the controls behind the consignment and talked about the business process and tried

to map the features of the business process with the item category.

Quite similar to how we have done it for material groups or material unknown.

Right.

There's no billing, hence no account assignment, no non-stock, so on and so forth.

And finally, we talked about subcontracting.

Again, we have briefly gone over the process of subcontracting and then listed out the features of

subcontracting business process and we were able to map feature by feature to the item category.

In the next section, we'll talk about account assignments.
