Let me just put it on paper.

So.

We determined that the manual reorder point is 500.

If the stock falls below 500, something needs to be triggered.

Initially the stock was zero and we ran.

MD03.

And the system generated some suggestions.

We went to Md0 for.

Which is stock requirement list the list of all the requirements and what happened to those requirements.

And found out that there was a purchase requisition.

Four £500.

Why 500?

Because the reorder point is 500 and there was no stock to start with.

So the first purchase requisition was created for £500.

And then.

The planner.

Converted.

The purchase requisition to a purchase order and the purchase order goes out to the vendor.

Po to vendor.

The vendor takes three days.

To deliver the goods.

And the good reaches are virus.

So we go to Miko.

And receive the goods.

Now, if you check the stock, we have £500 of coffee in.

So far, so good.

Now if you run again.

Now after this step.

If.

Run again.

Nothing happens.

The reason is pretty obvious.

Right.

There is enough stock.

Enough is 500.

So a number of times you run the Autobot.

Nothing happens.
