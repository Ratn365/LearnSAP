We need some kind of a centralized software.

So there's going to be some kind of a computer maybe in one of the main stores that every store manager

is a store one.

We have store to store.

Three.

Everybody should be able to log in to my server, just like you log in to Gmail and access it from anywhere.

Right?

So each of these store managers should be able to log in to the server and update the stock situation.

Like how much of stock is there at hand and what has been delivered.

So for example, if any time I want to know what is the stock situation in store two, I should be able

to know it.

Just go look up store two.

Maybe there's a separate folder for that on the server and get an idea.

This is the centralized software that we're trying to learn here.

Very simple.

Think of this as SAP.

I know it doesn't make sense to do SAP for three stores.

But imagine Starbucks.

It has thousands of stores and it's just an extension.

One store to store, three store, 100 stores, 1000 stores.

They are going to have some kind of an ERP and we are going to learn SAP with just three stores or two

stores.
