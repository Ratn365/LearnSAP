But what?

If I expand from one store to multiple stores, this is store one.

The next year I make some profits.

I'm going to open another store.

Can I keep filing papers?

And folders.

And keep doing the same business.

Well, let's see.

So I open my second coffee shop.

And I can't be at both places, right?

I have a manager here, so he or she is going to take care of the stuff and store too.

And I'm going to take care of the stuff and store one and we repeat the process again.

We have folders here.

One, two, three and four.

One for store one.

And another set of folders for store two.

So this manager.

So he does not understand purchasing.

So whenever there is a requirement for flour or sugar, he tells me.

And I am going to act on it.

Meaning I'm going to place a get the goods.

And he's going to tell me how much is in stock.

Just like store one has a factory to produce and store goods.

Store two is also going to have a factory.

How would I know?

What is the stock situation in stores?

Tools factory?

How would I know?

Goods consumption.

Meaning how much coffee is being consumed?

How much flour is being consumed?

How much goods are being created?

I wouldn't know unless I go to store too.

If store two is just nearby, I can just go there and then get the picture.

Imagine store to store three.

Store four, store five.

I cannot be everywhere.

I need some kind of a system that gives me a picture of the stock situation in any store that I own.

How do you solve that problem?
