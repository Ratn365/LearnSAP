So let's just recap what we have learned here.

So we have started out with a coffee shop.

We have understood the procurement lifecycle.

So there is a vendor who's going to supply the goods.

We're going to issue him a purchase order.

The vendor delivers the goods.

He also sends us the invoice.

After the goods have been delivered, of course.

And we send out a payment.

The first step is called the Poh.

The second step is called the goods receipt.

Or GR.

The third step is called invoice receipt or IRR.

And the final step is payment.

One, two, three and four.

That's the basic purchasing cycle.

And we have also understood that we need some kind of a centralized software that every store can log

in and update the situation and record their activities.

They could deliver their own goods.

They could place their own orders.

They know their stock situation.

They do their own payments.

So irrespective of the number of coffee shops that we have, if I have some kind of a centralized software.

That can record.

And manage these four different processes.

I've achieved the automation that I require that can easily scale up my purchasing.

And SAP is that ERP or software that we're going to use to record and manage these transactions.

And through the process we're going to learn SAP purchasing.
