Medical dispute.

We completed release indicators.

So let's go and create the release strategy or to release strategy like on new entries.

Let us give what is our release group?

D All right.

LP these F take start three one.

Less than adequate.

50 K Right.

Let's take it as having only one approval.

But listing manager is prerequisite not.

Blocked and at least.

If if any person was not able, then it is in proper state.

If the person is approved but is assisting manages ever then it status to enter to release.

Content classification.

See, I did not ascend anything read how it came documented.

Let me open this session.

It is this patient.

What else?

Just got.

Document every second of both values.

How it came to be participation, because we maintain it as a default value, right?

That said this was that automatically you got it.

The functionality, how it works is default.

And we also check the additional values, right?

It is not values means here you can see one on another option.

See?

Right.

Sorry.

That here we can maintain a new entry level so that we open purchase acquisition.

We can see someone has created A and B as a document.

What does the document have created?

Has it?

That in me.

That was created by me, actually.

Well, R&B is created by you.

Yeah, well, actually, they didn't.

Where?

I'll take it.

What is the PR document you created?

Hello?

Hello.

How is it?

What is the matter?

No independent calls.

Last time we talked about that, you already completed up to purchase order, he said.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

So.

Computer.

Yeah.

I mean, yeah.

Means a lot.

I mean, you could do configured anything or.

I mean, did you practice anything recording PR?

Yeah.

Yeah, of course.

I mean, I have a computer.

Oh, okay.

Then what is the matter, then?

Hello?

No, that is not okay.

R&B.

Okay.

Okay.

Another part of the equation.

Okay, let me give that input as here and you can enter.

See another input also taken, Right.

So that's the functionality of the additional values checkbox here.

Okay.

Do you want to add any new entry here?

You can add it.

Okay.

So let me take our and also.

Country C if it has now V given to entries as inputs.

Okay.

No.

And also go to basic data.

I maintain multiple values right here, multiple blocks.

It is showing as checkboxes.

If you maintain a single entry, it will become the radio button.

Radio button means we can select only a single value.

That's the difference between single value and multiple values.

Okay.

Total value of requisition.

It is also mean we maintained additional values and multiple values.

Let me go back and go to talk.

We maintain the original values and basic that we maintain in multiple ways, but multiple values we

do not maintain for total value, we maintain only a single value.

Select as less than 15.

But a group.

Let me take a deep, deep one.

Deep to three entries.

Go back and the concept.

Let's see the purchasing document we assigned to document documents, but we sent three document.

Okay.

If we create EPR with any document app or any of these group, then only the PR released will apply.

Okay.

Well back.

Listen, let us check how it works.

They released it.

It will become released

because this uncertainty was created.

Be Saturday as to.

If decay.

2101202.

That's prerequisite.

Take us.

What a surprise.

And then set up automobiles.

Stick how it works.

First one approves economic growth.

Then it released so it could go back.

Let's create another strategy.

The US.

Three necessary to unlock.

Unlock it

better than unlock.

Now let's take Ridley Scott's.

They started this.

R&B.

But like.

Incineration.

It's a good.

Okay.

They maintain three strategies right now.

Let's create a pier.

Let's see.

I think we ought to open the place.

Let's create.

51.

Paid parties requisition.

Let's take the alphabetized requisition.

Well, I'm putting my cooperation.

On a sample from science.

The object.

Why does management?

But Jesse.

Such as requisition order.

Define document types defined augment types.

What is our document?

Z And we read the mosque.

Mosque.

You go.

If you go to right there, you can see oral release of particular questions.

Right.

You need to check this box.

Okay.

And also I am checking for Ortonville.

So we need to check this out or requisition check box.

On off document, which is a Christian document.

Which are you going to create?

Conceal.

Okay, now let's create and 51.

Hmm.

Plan bb1 saw additional soon.

APC.

But.

Give me a minute.

Hello.

Yeah.

Hello, bro.

Yeah.

Yeah.

You can see that really started to to spread.

Yeah,

we got three years.

Let's see how much the value was.

The value was pretty lax, right?

So that's why it's having three episodes.

Let's see.

Let's take.

Below online.

Want to check.

50 to 1.

Right.

You should be proud of purchasing a system.

Another purchasing manager, which needs to be held to every.

Let's stick.

G is having only two personal.

Let me decrease it to less than 50.

It will have only one.

Click on check.

See, we're just having 1 to 1.

All right.

You can see also the strategy is changing as to to

keep it as relaxed only.

It will change the strategy to us.

Three.

The strategy has changed the concept.

But the speaker refused to release the purchase order.

In.

Part of the transaction could be used to release you still.

If 59 in.

Yeah.

59 and.

What is the transaction code?

Okay, give

me 29 and it's 34.

Be used to release the purchaser and May 29.

Now, if you want to release the PR, they have a code called 54 and.

54 and one section

disappear number.

Serious file.

Literally stab.

Click on this player to change.

As we released the in-app purchase order, same as PRL.

So we need to release.

We can see the status here.

See in participation, you can see the status.

We didn't discuss about it.

We discussed about this field.

You can see in release, right?

You can see in release zero two means.

It is that it does not have any release charge.

If it is a release option means the release strategy was triggered.

You need to after we release it completely, then the status will be changed to zero for release.

Completed.

Let's see.

I'm changed to only for one.

I'm changing for two.

Now I'm changing for 3 hours.

Click on sale.

The PR got released.

Now let's see.

Let's say I'm refreshed.

I'm refreshed.

And let's see how the status is changed from 0 to 2 03205.

Students.

But.

Dallas has not changed.

I.

Right.

Okay, Let me check with this.

Okay.

It needs to be changed to the truth.

Actually, if we release completely, then the status will be changed.

I need to check why the status is not changing.

Okay.

Please do use.

Attrition through this procedure.

But a classification setup procedure with classification.

And release group.

I told you about this, Red.

If you check this a button, it is called oral release.

If you check, it is called item level.

Right?

It's on sale now.

Can you go back or is this window?

Let's go to different document types, which we checked were all related right in it and check it,

Heroes in it and check it here and click on see.

Let me create a fear.

And one more thing.

We need to change the configuration.

So.

But his requisition.

Police procedure.

Procedural classification.

Actually, we are saying total level, right?

Top level of the table.

We are saying seek feedback.

DFW.

All right.

It is full throttle values had that level.

GSW dx is for item level OC.

What the difference is.

Actually, let me change the configuration or this total value.

Then there's no data.

I think we can't change it here.

Let me take

let me add another characteristics

item.

You

see

s.w.o.r.d., right?

Currency.

I'm making it as a single value and needs to be allowed.

And use them.

Take it to ten K and rather than one like.

To.

I still go back?

That may send this to any classes.

Actors.

So I think.

Let me get upper class for the change mode.
