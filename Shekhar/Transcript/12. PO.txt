Yeah.

Do you guys understand it?

Right.

How we are going to create the budget this year, how the massive data is helping and how it is fetching

to purchase order.

You understand that?

Yeah.

Let us display this bill which we created.

Yeah.

How many dates will be available.

We are people.

We are having 100 details.

These are called details.

It is not like item or item item value data.

It is called item details Data and item details.

Each tab having the relevant data.

One Metadata is having relevant material information like what is a metal group?

If the vendor is having another metal number for the same metal number in the company so that we can

maintain the vendor metal number like that.

Some information will be available on how much quantity we ordered, how much quantity we ordered under

boxes.

Right.

And in both cases, what is the stock keeping unit 500 inches, right, Because one box equal to five,

that's where the stock keeping unit is.

500 each.

Right.

Yeah.

And what is the network?

For 50 grams and also it is 500 grams.

But because a major modulator, what we maintain actually for each how much weight.

Let's see.

So two basic data, 100 grams write down to one, one box equal to five.

So 185 500 growth weight is 505 in 294 450.

Right.

So two for 50 is nitrate and the growth rate is 500.

You got one box.

It is showing like this CrossFit is 500 rounds and that it is for $50 or £50.

Just then go to the schedule.

What is the delivery date here?

We can see we maintained a two day date.

21, 2022.

Yeah.

That's why it is showing 21.

2022.

Scheduled quality was 100 and to is scheduled to deliver this date.

Google says it is not completed.

That's why it is not updated here.

So that's the open quantities.

And if you received it will become 101.

We will become zero.

Okay.

In delivery tab, what are the details available?

Let's see our delivery tolerance and under delivery programs and shipping instructions.

What are the shipping instructions we want to give to the vendor we can maintain at Metal Master data

Also that or else in the info recorders we can maintain so that it would automatically copy to order.

And as I will tell you this, our delivery under delivered orders while we are receiving the goods into

the inventory at that point of time.

I will explain you about this.

Feels okay.

If I explain to you right now, it will be.

Difficult for you to understand while doing the transactions.

I will explain it better and also remind us, actually, these remainders will maintain that metro market

data.

The shipping instructions and reminders so we can maintain it, because actually what these reminders

are, we ordered the 100 boxes to deliver 25, 21, 2200.

The vendor is not sending on the delivery date.

Then we can schedule a reminder for them.

And the second thought, Amanda, like that, we can set the reminders to give the reminders to vendor.

We can maintain the reminders here.

Okay.

-- invoice.

Invoice.

We need to check invoice receipt.

And.

So we need to maintain some based verification activities and secure.

They need to maintain this based I've.

Thinking separately taken from the.

Okay.

We need to check this.

The air base to be okay.

Okay.

What is this?

Your best ivy hazard?

I told you yesterday, right?

Yeah.

Hello?

Yeah, I know.

When we reviewed the good luck.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

It's like a like a skirt giving away the.

Hello?

Yeah.

When we receive the goods, they will give an invoice for it.

Like we get an invoice along with the goods.

Yeah.

The those who invest should maintain.

Okay.

Like, let's assume like this if you order 100 boxes.

Right.

But the vendor will not send 100 boxes, let's say.

Then he sent the goods to us like 50 boxes.

Okay.

Yeah.

While we are creating the invoice, actually copies the quantity from the three, the quantity 100 boxes,

but we receive 50 quantity.

Right.

If you check this database in-house verification, then we enter in.

After this Java check, we received 50 boxes.

Then the system means automatically copies to 50 quantity only, not 100.

That's the control of this database.

Okay.

Yeah.

And this is called tax code.

We need to do some tax configuration like we purchasing materials.

Right.

So we need to pay some tax amount to the vendor.

Right.

That's why we maintain some tax codes at the OR whatever else.

It is an optional.

We can maintain it top over others.

We can maintain it in a sufficient.

Look.

Conditions.

Actually, we're having a pricing procedure concept where we know the what are the condition types and

how it is getting automatically into this purchase order.

That concept called purchase, the pricing procedure topic.

I will explain you that these are called condition types actually like vendor.

We will give some discount rate cash discounts that will be having one condition type and the vendor

will will need to pay to the vendor like the transportations are the five charges so that it will be

having another condition type color for even other for one like some condition types will be available

during the pricing procedure concept.

I will explain the

delivery address.

What is the delivery address plan?

Right.

We will get the plant name.

Where is the street?

Where is the what is the country?

What is the reason?

What is the post code like that The address will be displayed here.

Yeah.

Okay.

And.

And another on confirmation control.

I will explain you.

In fact, the sessions.

Okay.

If I tell you right, it will be confused.

Confusion for you.

Let me explain another top.

Okay, this is about purchase order.

And also, I don't want a single item, right?

Yeah, whatever.

Actually, if you order multiple items, we can also see total condition value at their level, as they

shown you yesterday.

For all the line items it be calculated, it will sum all the prices and it will show you and header

level.

Okay.

Yeah.

That is called condition.

And if you want to give any other instructions, we can maintain it.

Have the level.

And if you want to maintain line item, which we can maintain at the line item level so that we created

another product and series to.

No.

It is one.

Yeah.

You can see, right.

We are having to line items.

What is the price?

Let's see.

Plus one having 4000 price, right?

802.

How much quantity?

50.

Right.

So 18 to 50 like that.

It is calculating and giving the total condition value 4000.

Let's go to the second line item.

Piston.

Piston.

96,096 plus 4000.

One of the great.

Yeah.

Let's see.

But like.

So you can see.

Right.

One leg, total value.

So that's a benefit for harder conditions and we can maintain for borderline items.

We kind of want to give the section.

We can maintain it at that level tax.

And if we want to maintain for each item, each item, if you want to give the instructions or if you

want to sell anything to the vendor about these materials, we can maintain it.

Item level.

Item level.

Also, we can maintain the textiles.

See, this is for our line item one.

This column line item at here.

Also you can.

Okay.

Do you have any questions regarding this purchase order?

How we are using the Master Data master to render massive data.

The info record source is to create the purchase order.

Okay, so we create all this master data, and the data purchase are like a purchase requisition.

We easily get this purchase order, right?

Like we can.

Yes.

Right.

Because actually this purchase orders will created by users every day.

So many purchase orders will be created, thousands of purchasers will be created.

They don't have the knowledge to I mean, they don't have a button to maintain all these things in mind,

right?

So they want we need to automate and we need to do the work as easy as possible to the user that's only

maintaining this master data.

So whenever they want a metal, they simply maintain the materials here, They simply go and create

the purchase orders.

That's it.

Because there are thousands of materials available and each one is procuring from multiple vendors.

So multiple vendors having multiple prices, how they can remember those, all these materials and all

those prices.

But that's why we are maintaining the master data.

Okay.

Okay.

Got it.

And also, it will increase the efficiency of the verticals, whether they may do some mistakes also.

Right.

Instead of giving eight groups, they can maintain 800.

Right.

Right.

That's why if we maintain right there in the master data levels, then that right data will be getting

into the purchase order so it doesn't have any mistakes.

While we're creating purchase order, then it is a benefit for the company, right?

That is very efficient.

That's why we are maintaining the master data.

So that is where we are always telling that Master That is very important.

After that we live.

We use by using the master data we use, we run the business transactions.

Okay.

Any questions as it.

I'm not real clear.

Okay.

Okay, let me.

Quick recap.

Do you have any questions?

Actually, I have some doubts.

And the socialists, as you said.

Angela Davis Yes, but, you know, under fire.

I believe that if we don't do anything, any socialist, so what will happen?

But actually, if you don't mind that process, see?

So this is the optional bill.

The company knows like vendors or whatever they can produce.

Years from now, a vendor ballot period is coming later and everything.

So if they want to control the user to create unnecessary purchase orders to the vendor, it's a legal

document, right?

Because it's an ID to send to the vendor, right, actually.

So that's why it's having a control over there.

Do not create any unnecessary people to other vendors.

And also in this horserace, which is having some validity period.

Right.

A few materials will be procured from vendor and we are having some contracts rights contract.

We're having a concept called actually outline agreement in that we are having the contract on the contract.

There is a concept called outline agreements.

Hello.

However.

Yeah.

Sorry.

My internet having some issues.

Yeah.

In that contract we are having like six months of period or one year of period like that.

We are having some contact with the vendor, actually.

Okay.

In general, it's a common understanding between two parties to supply certain materials on specific

terms and conditions.

Normally these agreements are entered between vendors and company on mutual benefit based.

Order.

We are right.

So the benefit to the vendor and also we are getting a better price, right?

Like if the item price is ₹100, if you buy on bulk and have any agreement with the vendor, then they

will give you for ₹90 or ₹80 like that.

They will give you the matter of price.

So those contracts will be entered in source list to the valid period.

Okay, then.

Okay.

In the result will be maintaining only.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

If we don't maintain the input record, a French socialist is different.

I mean, political is different.

Yes.

So this is different.

And in particular is different because so in socialist, we maintain the validity period of the.

What?

What?

What are the list of vendors?

To procure the material from.

And but in in our record, we maintain the validity period of the price, not vendors list of vendors

validity.

We maintain the price value to be valid period of the price from which vendor, which only one vendor.

That's it.

It is a combination between only one vendor and one material.

So I'm reading this purchase order.

Hasbro I'm creating the purchase order.

We should also maintain this in order.

If a company needs it, then only we maintain the protocol.

We suggest them to maintain the record.

If they don't, if the business is very small, like the prices was changes frequently and they are

using only few materials to procure, then did doesn't require any protocols.

If it's a small company and they were having only 50 to 100 materials, then they don't require any

info records.

Both of these are obscene.

There's no knob.

But if you did.

Yeah, that's why creative.

I assure you, the manual creation of purchase order.

In manual creation of purchase order.

I given the price of the material and I only given the vendor name on the material name, right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's a difference between manual creation and.

Automatically getting the price from the info record and along with the value the period of the event.

If you want it, then only if we act with the source list configuration at material level or plant level.

Okay.

Okay.

Simple.

Bella.

This is part dedication, right?

Let's take one participation we created.

If you see the status tab, you can see the status tab, right?

Hello.

Guys, are you there?

Why don't you go to status there?

And here we can see if the pier is converted into people.

B, we can see the purchase order number is updated here.

And crossing state these people created.

You can see it, right?

But without a doubt, my number.

Kinsey.

Yeah.

If you go to the second line to see a number will be available because we created people with two line

items that see second line items.

If you double click on it.

Then it will take us to the purchase order.

Kinsey.

The parties are here.

Imperial state is updating whether the war is created or not.

We can see in step or step.

Okay.

She.

And.

That is about the purchase order.

I think you guys understand.

Please practice and.

Hello.

Yeah.

Gabba.

Yeah.

Any questions regarding purchase order or any other topics?

Bill?

No, we covered like mashed potatoes transaction letters like PR out of few quotation.

But as the.

Any questions?

Noble.

Noble.

Okay.
