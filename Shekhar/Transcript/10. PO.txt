Yeah.

Today we are going to discuss about a purchase order.

Okay, purchase order is in the cycle.

We created participation and the quotation and also we maintain the vendor quotation in the quotation

after the request for quotation, we need to maintain the vendor quotation, right?

Then we done the comparison and we selected one number.

Now we are going to create a purchase order based on the situation created, right?

What are the requirements they want?

We need the order to demand.

Today we are going to discuss the purchase order.

It is an outgoing document and it's a legal document sent to the vendor to procure the material.

Okay.

But it means okay.

And just like parties requisition and request for quotation, we need to define the number and purchase

orders and we need to assign the number ranges to document that.

What is the standard argument for participation?

And then the third part is also the same document that will be used for standard document type.

And okay, because of its attached server, we need to copy from standard entry and we maintain Z and

B are weighing in real time.

If it's a test server, right, if anybody uses PCR, then we can go with the another alphabet.

It's not an issue in the test server, but in real time we use only Z are for creating customized document

types.

Okay.

Okay.

Let me take you to the configuration.

Let me share my screen.

Okay.

They are able to see on screen.

Yeah.

Yeah.

This battle.

Three different subject materials management, but chasing an opportunity.

We need to go to purchase order here.

We need to define the number and we need to send it to the document.

Okay.

I'll go to the number.

Yes.

Let's go and see what are the instruments available.

So let's check.

Can see.

Different kind of number in this world available.

From this, we can take one number and go back.

Let's see.

You go to all of you.

Select a phone number.

Make it in ascending order.

Let's see, what is the last number they use as used?

And those are the nine cities.

Like 90,000.

So let's take it another.

One nine series thousand.

Let's take nine cities.

Thousand one.

Some might think a button.

Extra symbol.

Let's be, baby.

I was the one.

Oh, 2000.

Okay, So I mean this.

We see.

Then given the the number of DP Slovak.

Photo document apps.

The fundamental.

I think some years it was locked.

When you get the lock on entry.

You come and go to a central transaction as central slasher music is opening in your window as central.

What is a user I.D.?

You need to paste it here and then use it to the list.

Just select all these entries you can't delete.

Bones.

Then the blog entries will be deleted.

No.

Will close this window again.

Go to the front of impact.

The document will be shown here.

What is the standard document for us?

I need it and I need to search for standard document.

The seeds the NBA already created by some other person that some other person is using the NBA.

So let us create the demand.

But in real time, we use the Z or Y Plus preferences Z and in Z and second preferences.

But in the end, that.

Just copy the standard one click on copy as.

Make it as the DMV.

They'll keep it as a distraction.

They'll see standard people.

Recommended.

I'll be on.

A little different this year.

You can see Sarah at the end.

Let's go to the number range in trouble.

Let's take it.

Action on an internal number is what is a number is we created the API.

We need to assign it here.

We don't declare an actual number and keep it as blank.

So I already told you about this right item.

And if it is a ten, it will be looping like ten plus 1020.

Next item, 34.

Okay.

He said.

The council.

Get it.

It's not ours.

So go to request and select others for this.

Ours.

Then she automatism is.

Not going to be confined in.

So the document that was defined and also the number range was estimate range, so defined as include

this document.

So the configuration was completed

for parties orders, variation of purchase order.

We use the transaction code code and we can do one slight change.

They use the 20 data and.

But this play.

We use the money.

20 trillion.

Family stuff.

Purchase orders.

List of diverse orders.

We use the decor and meet to L or semi to L by vendor.

If you want to see the material of the stock purchase order, we can go with them to and.

Okay.

Now let's go and create purchase order, slash and kill this current window open in the same window.

21 And that.

Just like budgetary creation, it would be having some dark matter.

Please select Z and B.

Okay.

What are the requirements we created?

Let's see.

Slash 25 here.

You see the list of participation side?

If I get to see Mr. Ford Expedition or this other purchasing group, let us get the plan.

But this plant, how many parties equations are available to be displayed to connect skew.

And also the quality of the product is very good on the market.

We selected below.

So after that we will need to create info record rate.

It is a one time job, actually.

Every time we do not process the RFQ on quotation, once we choose them, the vendor then automatically

after a year we directly create a purchase order seven times.

Let us take the out based on the company code.

I'm taking the list of vendors.

Let's look at the villa.

Based on that, we can create the purchase order number.

If you scroll to the right side.

You can see the party's requisition

Taken Baldwin's bold piston from the Berkshires requisition.

Yet here you can see 508.

Right.

But here you can see 50 boxes this way.

Each box contain continued strength because we maintain our unit as box, right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

So from peer to peer were converted into boxes.

So one box equal ten, which is Right.

So 100, but an equal 50 so it can into 50 box.

And we made system one box equal to two.

Eat just right.

So we ordered 200 Eastman's 200 by two equal to 100.

100.

Okay.

You've got converted, right.

You understand.

But yeah.

Yeah.

This conversion where we got maintained in info record, right.

Info record we maintained.

At one box.

How much price?

A therapist at Ruby's.

And also we maintain the record that one meets water quality.

It is automatically taken from the info record.

We didn't maintain any prices in people, right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's why we are using the info record for the prices.

If I am an user, I do not remember all the prices of the materials which are procuring from vendors.

Right.

So if you maintain the info record, then the price will be automatically taken from the info record

automatically.

You got it.

Why?

We are using it to record.

Yeah.

Yeah.

If you want to see the info record number generator if you go to scroll to Right said you can see the

period.
