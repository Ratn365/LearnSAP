Okay.

Today we are going to discuss about purchasing for record.

So it is one of the master data.

What is purchasing for record?

It is a relationship between a specific material supplying to a specific plant by a specific vendor

along with his price.

Terms and conditions is nothing but partisan political

parties record info record.

What we maintain is the vendors price for the material.

We will maintain an info record and also use terms and conditions like minimum or quantity.

You need to order to me like some thousand quantity or something because for example, if you're ordering

material, let's let's assume our company, our plant is located at Hyderabad, the vendor is located

at Bangalore.

Whenever we order, if you order some 100 or something, the transportation costs is very high, very

small quantity.

The vendor had some limits and some conditions like you must order minimum 1000 quantity then only I

will deliver the goods to your workplan like that.

He will maintain some terms and conditions and also the vendor will give us better discount price because

we are procuring the companies procuring in a bulk quantity.

Right.

If you buy in bulk quantity every month, on every day, in every one week or something, the vendor

will give you some discount rather than the market rate.

For example, the meter x, the cost is ₹100 in the market.

The vendor may give it for ₹95 or ₹90 or something.

Because we have a government that I like, we procure the material continuously from the same end so

that it will be a benefit for the vendor and also benefit for the company is a mutual benefit based,

right.

So the agreement will be happen.

So that price, what are the increment price we need to maintain it in one place.

Okay.

We will discuss agreements also we will have some agreement, normal agreement like we will procure

these materials.

Could you please reduce the price because we are procuring any quantity?

Then the matrix is 100% market.

Then the price will be given by the vendor is 95.

So that price we will maintain in protocol.

And also it is a greater advantage that during the creation of purchase order, the price will be suggested

from the vertical.

Once you maintain purchasing for the cost system will suggest the price when you create a purchase order.

Okay.

That is one of the great advantages in record.

And also the record has some validity period of the price From this month to two months, the price

will be ₹95.

After that, I will give you four only for ₹97 to the vendor.

Then we will maintain after two months the price.

We can maintain both validity periods.

We maintain 95%, 97% in full record.

That is the purpose of the master data, like the purchasing for record.

You understand the concept, right?

Joseph?

Yes.

Yeah.

As the same way we're here.

Also.

We will maintain one number range and we will define we have some standard document type.

Ideal is the standard document type for purchasing.

For record.

We will assign the number range to that document type.

And whenever you create the purchasing for record, the number range will be assigned to it.

Whether it is actual number or number you want to go with.

Okay, Let me go into superstition and let me show you the configuration and the creation of master

data.

And for the.

Yeah.

Tell me, Joseph.

Yes?

Can you please help me to.

How to how to get this ASAP, Page?

Yeah.

At the end of the session, I will help you.

Okay?

Fine, fine, fine.

Split and go to separate friends.

And you.

And then you need to go for metrics management.

You can see the measures management and code purchasing.

And here we can see purchasing for.

Here you can see defining the Rangers defense.

I already told you that screen layout means for which film you want to maintain it as a mandatory or

optional or display.

How do you want to suppress it?

You can do that acting defense cleanly.

And here you can see that the fine number in just click on Execute.

Here.

You can see the intervals, but we want to display it.

So these are the number ranges for available.

You want to go with the new number range?

You can create it and also go to groups.

Here you can see AGL is the standard document that.

We want to create a new group and the new number range to it.

Then you can go ahead and do it, see what is the list of number and just have.

These are deadly stuff now letting us see.

Sort it out.

The last number they use it is five six series.

We can go with five, seven series.

Click on Mark Button where we can create the group.

If you can't see it, I will maintain the.

Food court.

But it.

But sometimes that effect does go with some cities.

The scared.

So the was created with number range.

Now we will assign this group to our document.

Here it is.

I'll use the standard document.

I put the cursor here.

Click on Eliminate the group assignment.

And what is our chosen info record number?

Range zero two.

Right.

Select it and click on.

So that if we assign to our member now click on See No Changes has zero.

This is the configuration.

It's a small configuration for the info record.

We define number range and we send it to one document type, which is nothing, but I'll use the standard

time for input.

It also the transaction codes we use for info record for creation is an 11.

And MI 11 is to create the info record.

OC If you want to change a chemical and display a meeting and if you want to leave stuff in for the

course, then you can go with one or anyone and anyone else by vendor wise.

And if you want to go with metal, well then you can go with the transaction code and.

That does enter m 11 here.

You need to maintain the vendor who is the vendor is responsible to deliver the goods to our plan.

For each meter, this is the material.

Who is the responsible person to procure this material?

This is the purchasing organization.

We need to maintain all these fields and info record.

It is assigned automatically because we are using a internal numbering.

If you go with external numbers, we need to maintain that number here.

Now let us select our vendor.

One of the vendors, we created some vendor side.

What?

It is a search box.

We can go with the our company code.

It's not.

So that it will display all the info.

Sorry, all the vendors under this company.

These are the vendors we created.

Let us go with Burn Notice

and make it.

We created zero ordered.

These are the materials.

So.

Protesting their level of partisan organization, you know, by changing our nation and trying to create.

These fees we need to maintain.

And here we need to select the standard info category remaining three or common special procurements.

During that special procurement concept, I will explain more about these import records.

So contacting Pipeline and Consignment search standard.

Today we are going to discuss about this standard and select the standard.

And now click on Enter.

Here the vendor details you need to maintain and reminders.

And if the material number is our company's material number here, vendors having any other material

number, we can maintain it here like that.

Some salesperson, it will be coming from vendor master data.

Can we maintain some sales personnel telephone number?

Right.

Inventory data.

It is captured from vendor master data and this order unit conversion will be captured from your master

data you don't require to maintain anything here, click on Enter.

See my delivery time.

Then whenever you order how many days the vendor need needs to deliver it to our client.

For example, when you order today, it will take some around three days or something.

That does mean that we need to maintain here some standard quantity.

Let us maintain some thousand minimum order quantity that's maintenance and some standard quantity and

minimum quantity.

You must order whatever the quantity we maintain here.

Vendor will tell.

I'll tell you that vendor will tell some terms and conditions like you must order minimum quantity of

some x quantity.

Let us maintain here under quantity.

And here we need to maintain the vendors price, not the materials price.

Whatever the vendor giving the discount price, we need to maintain that what level of price we maintain

data that is check zero three.

Continue.

Let's see how much price we maintain.

We maintain ₹200.

Let's say some.

He was giving for one ₹90.

Now enter quotations not required here.

If you want to maintain any instructions or any text you can maintain here, it would be getting into

the purchase order.

Skip.

See then for code was created.

This is how we maintain the vendor's pricing info record.

If we want to go on change, slash an army mutual visa transaction where we can change the info record.

See, these are the details.

See, I told you that we can maintain the value, the period of the vendor.

Right.

Put the cursor here.

If you click on this conditions button, it is.

Show some value from one value to see from five five today.

Date two till 31.

Double, double and double.

Here.

This is the value repeated.

Put the cursor here and click on choose.

See, this is the price here.

Let's say I don't want this price to increase.

I want to this price.

The vendor is giving only for up to two months or one month.

Five.

Let us maintain only for 34.

This price will be only from value from FY FY 2022 to 31 five 2020.

Okay, let me change that.

Okay.

And again, I'm going to say, but choosing one side after one month of period after one month.

C 31 five, 20, 22 after one month, the vendor is not giving for one empty rupees.

He was giving for one ₹95.

How we can maintain here you can see new validity period because new validity period.

And here you can give it as.

31st June, first onwards to seven June, ending June 20 up to June 30, he was giving for one ₹95.

We can't sit here and go with the display and meet at.

So it is in display mode and they are going for purchasing of data and click on conditions.

You can see two valid periods here.

See, current price is one in rupees because it is in this validity period, it is showing one ₹90.

And let us select second one we can choose.

It will show you 195.

See?

And if you select first one.

It's better to go into it at

the conventions and put together for the period you can choose so that it will show you online database.

Okay.

This is how we can maintain the price based on the value, the period of.

Okay.

Joseph, do you have any questions regarding your record?

No, no.

Let us go with another market data.

It's a small market data, which is nothing but socialist.

What do you mean by this socialist?

It is a relationship between a material versus vendors along with his their value periods.

For example, the matrix is procuring from four vendors, four sources.

Then those list of sources will be maintaining that source.

And also it is having a great control over in purchase order.

When you maintain these four sources in the source list, then the system won't allow you to create

a purchase order other than those force sources.

Okay.

See, let me show you that how to create these sources, it can be activated at plant level or else

metal level.

Both ways we can maintain and activate that.

Let me show you that.

First of all, let me show you the plant level activation.

After that, after that, I will show you much data activation.

Either you can go with plant level, then it will be applicable for all the metals in the plant.

If you want to maintain only a particular matter material, then I mean if you want to activate it for

the particular material, you can go with material level.

Let me show you how to activate the source list at plant level.

Go to SP.

A civil events.

AMG And then go to Matrix management.

Here we define purchasing for record.

Now we are going to do this source list master data.

Here you can see defined socialist requirement and plant level.

We can execute.

What is our plan b, c, H, PD-L1?

If you activate it here, then it will be applicable for all the materials under this plan.

Okay.

What else?

I will maintain sources to estimate material level.

If we want to activate it client level, it will be applicable for all the materials under the added.

Let me show that in the master data level one of the material and to change it the gate level and go

to purchasing.

And if you dropped down this here, you can see the socialist checkbox.

That means check this.

It means it will be activated at material level.

And whenever you create the purchase order, the system is such as?

Such for this source in this source list.

If the source is not maintained in the source list, also the system won't allow it to create the purchase

order.

Because we have the source list at material level.

If the source is available, then only that source only can create the purchase order.

Source is nothing but a vendor.

So like Mac widget material level.

So and if I want to go on with it, may a plant level also you can maintain that C select this product

checkbox and save it.

Executive branch level, either maintain at material level or else at plant level.

If you maintain at plant level, you're not required to maintain it material level because it already

activated to all the materials and that this plant.

Let's check this out.

Now, what is a code to maintain the list of sources in this source list?

Transaction is a me zero 111 is for creation of info record.

The middle one is for creation of sources.

Okay, we can enter.

It will ask you to enter the what is the material and under which plan it is automatically taken.

Because just now we use this material so as automatically taken this material to do not know about the

material, then you can click on this button and search for the material.

And so you can go with the material type.

And Richard is available to step us now and see.

It is asking what is the value depicted of the window and when the name and what is the information

is responsible for it.

Okay.

Remaining fields we will discuss about later.

Like whenever you get some agreements contracts during that point of time I will explain you the mining

fields.

Okay.

See, we need to maintain here the validity period.

Let's say I will maintain from five five.

So let's say that only one month.

But in real time, it will be having your voice.

Let me guess.

Okay.

And inside the window.

Richmond is a company called

interstate

Demand and it parties people and

to one sort.

And also the same will be procured from multiple vendors.

Then we can maintain the remaining.

Are.

That does make them both limited.

Here's another one.

And if you want to borrow the list of sources available, you can maintain that and you can maintain

the valid period.

And also few companies is like that.

They will be procuring the vendors.

One month is really I mean, let's zoom up to June month, up to 32 men manning some models.

And after the May month they will procure some of.

From June onward they will be procuring from some Washington vendor this kind of business.

Also they will use.

What are the validity periods and what are the list of sources we can.

We will maintain this source list whenever we create a purchase order.

The system will only allow what are the list of sources available in this purchase order?

For example, the maze completed.

Let's assume payment is completed, that June is come.

Then when you create the purchase order with respect to this vendor, then the system is owned.

Allow you to create a purchase order because the valid period was completed so you can create a purchase

order to it.

The system won't allow you to create the purchase order during the creation of purchase order.

You can understand how the modulators are very useful.

And also we have some conceptual sources determination concept during that time.

Also, the source list is very useful.

I will tell you how it works during the source determination, guns and automatic people.

These kind of things we can and also we can maintain one of the vendors affected vendor.

And if you want to block this vendor for some time, you can block the server, block the box.

If you check this box, it means the vendor is blocked.

This means it is called Fix the source.

Fix it for this material.

You can maintain those functionalities and remaining fields.

I will explain you that during we have some agreements, those agreements, we can assign it here based

on that Also, those will still be determined.

No, let me save this.

This was this was great.

This is how we create the source list.

Any questions yourself?
