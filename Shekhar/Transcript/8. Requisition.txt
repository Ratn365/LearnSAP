Today we are going to discuss a boat purchase acquisition.

So what is purchase acquisition?

It is a request to be made to the purchasing organization by any department, whether it is a production

department or any other department to procure certain list of materials on this scheduled date is nothing

but purchase requisition.

So a any department, if they required any materials, they will request to be made to the purchasing

nation.

What is a purchasing organization?

It is a responsible department to procure the materials from external sources.

Right.

So we call it a purchase requisition.

So in this purchase equation, what we do is from prospective we will define one document and we assign

one number range to it.

Whenever a user will create a particular question with respect to that document.

The unit number will be assigned to the purchase requisition.

I will show you that configuration.

First, we need to define one document, the standard document type for purchase equations and.

And with the standard document type, this document type will be assigned to one number range.

Whenever we create a question with respect to this document, when a unique number will be assigned

to the particular creation every time.

Let me take you to a safe system.

So let me show you the configuration and then we will create the recreation.

Configuration or the transaction per we use SPR.

Friends are angry.

And then we need to go for materials management.

Here it is.

Go to metals management and then go to purchasing.

In this effort we define partizan for record.

And so right now we are going to do the configuration for purchase requisition.

And that is participation.

We have two options like define the number ranges and then define document types.

Okay.

First of all, let's create one number range and then we will assign that number range to this document.

First, let me create one number range.

Click on execute if you want to see the list of number ranges.

You can either you can go with the display and it will show you the intervals.

These are the intervals I'm number ranges was created by the users.

But in real time these many number ranges are not available, but few number ranges because it is a

test server.

So many users was created.

So many number ranges.

And let me go to the overview.

I mean, again, see how what are the numbering is available, I think for this is not used.

Let's take the four series number.

If you want to see a detailed view, like in ascending order, go to this overview button so that it

will show you the number ranges.

Select from one from number range and click on ascending order.

It will show you in ascending order based on that.

Also, you can pick the number range.

I can go with the after this number in like eight series, 900 orders.

We do not have any force.

It is number range.

So I will go and create it for series number range.

You can't benchmark button change intervals.

And here you need to give some serial number.

Here you can give the character like we have.

It is Honda motors or something.

But this you can go with the numerical.

I will go with the numerical.

After zero eight, you can take the zero nine.

I think four cities is not used for cities.

DEADLINE.

Let's save this number.

I defined one number.

It is an internal number.

Okay.

I didn't check this.

That means it is an internal number range.

If you check this box, then means it is an actual number.

You need to give the participation number manually during the creation of.

And then you need to go for document types.

We have a standard document already existed in the system, but we do not do any changes to the I mean,

you do not use the standard one because it is just a test server.

So we need to copy this document and we will make it as in some customers document like Z and B, and

we need to change these number in the server.

But in real time we use the standard document, but it is a test server.

That's the reason we do not use the standard, because we do not affect the standard functionality because

it is used by so many users.

We do not disturb anything.

And also in real time we use customization document types as well if business requires.

Then select this document type and click copy as I'm copying the new document type to.

I told you that if you copy anything, if you do any customization, put Z in front of it.

Right?

You need to put the Z in front of it.

And I'm doing this internal and external number ranges.

I'm using only internal.

What is our internal number?

Range.

Number.

What else?

If you do not know number, if you forget it, just click on this button so that it will show you the

number in this.

Okay, select our number.

We do not use any actual number.

Let's leave it.

And this is a free field selection screen layout.

We have a sum required field on the optional field.

We already discussed about if that field selection reference can be assigned here.

I will show you that as well.

Now click on Enter.

Copy on.

Click on copy so that it will copy all the entries.

Continue.

So that then we document as copy to Z and we document that.

Now click on.

So we defined one number range and we assign our number range to the document.

Let me change the description as well.

It is

on the.

But choosing a good.

I changed the description as well so that you can identify easily go back.

So the configuration was completed.

I told you that.

Screenplay Fields reference.

Right.

See Field selection key.

It is for Zn be the standard for selection keys and VB.

Let's go and see.

See if I'm screen layout at document type double click on execute party sees field selection key and

B right.

And maybe select the dnb and go to details.

These are the views selection screens.

See where we can maintain the required entry or optional or display entry where if you want to purchase,

has mandatory field here.

If you can't enter the purchasing group, the system won't allow you to create the purchase requisition.

If you may want to maintain storage location with this field, one you want to maintain as required

or optional or display you can maintain here.

Supplying plan to mining next.

I mean, different types of field labels on the field label, different kind of fields will be available,

which will be one domain then as required or option you can maintain here under this.

And maybe

now let us create the participation.

Creation.

We use the transaction code 51 for change.

52 for display and 63.

And if you want to see the list of purchase requisitions.

An MI5 report where we can see the list of bills.

Let us create what we shall now.

And we 51 And.

See, this is a great participation scheme in participation.

We are having three types of data.

One is header data.

Second one is item value data and third one is item details Data.

What are the entries you maintain an item of you that details will be reflected into this item.

Request data as.

Just dropped on this button.

I mean, you can see dropdowns, right?

If you click on it, it will drop down the details.

See?

Okay.

And here you need to enter the material number.

How much do you required?

I mean, delivering it when will be required and what is the plan and for which plan You require this

material under which story, location, who is the person is responsible to procure this material?

And the questioner means who wants this material arising?

This requisition is nothing but requisition.

And if you know the vendor, you can maintain vendor number here or else if you're having any fixed

vendor to this material, you can maintain here.

Right now.

Let's assume we do not know the vendor.

Okay.

And then we need to maintain the patches patches organization so that we maintain the material.

See here you can see here our document.

What is our document Z and B on the purchasing requisition.

Maintain this purchase requisition.

Okay.

Now select Limited.

Click on this button so that it will show you the selection parameters like let us go with the Z parameters

while our middle type is zero.

No.

Let's take a question.

I had acquired some 100 quantity and brandies HP on the plant one So the location is one one and purchasing

group is HPG.

And the acquisition let's assume Joseph needs is an estimate area.

When let's assume we do not know the vendor right now because we raise the request for quotation and

quotation and comparisons.

We will do that.

So let's say then we do not know the vendor.

And here the purchasing organization HDPE.

These are purchasing organization reminding details like short text material group.

These details will be captured from the middle March data.

We already maintain the master data.

It will capture from that.

And also the price will be taken from the metal.

Massive C and then click on enter.

The Remain data will be pulled from the master data.

C unit of measure pulled from our data hub group Honda Maxx.

Items will be captured from Metal Master Data.

See here.

When I click on Enter, then following details will be reflected in the item details.

It will show you details, complete details of the material.

This item details.

See what is the matter number?

What is the short tag?

So what is the metal group and go to quantities.

How much quantity you ordered?

100 quantity.

Okay.

What is the delivery date?

We pick six, five, 20, 22.

Let's take it as taken by the system.

Let's take this.

Seven 11th of May.

And then.

Valuation.

If we go to valuation, we can see the price.

2000.

We didn't maintain any valuation price in this particular question, but it automatically assigned how

it is assigned because it's taken from the master data.

You want to see that?

Just click on the material.

Then it will take you to the master data.

Go to accounting view.

It will show you the price since 2000 will be captured from Master Data.

That's the reason we are maintaining always the master data.

And source of supply because we do not have the we do not know the vendor.

So we do not have seen anything here.

And contact person.

It will be taken from the requisition and created by banker.

This is the user related to banker.

So when it is assigned here.

And this is a telephone number coming from.

Now a partisan group.

Partisan group.

We maintain the telephone number.

So from there it is looking.

And if you want to maintain any text and if you want to give any instructions to this material, you

can maintain here and deliver this.

What is the delivery?

This is the plan.

Read plan.

This will be sent here.

See the manufacturing plan?

That is sheet.

What is that?

Status will be captured here.

And then let's assume the same request.

Joe, Joseph needs to materials so we can maintain.

We need to maintain new second line item level.

And is our materials right?

Let us take like.

Distributor or distributor and required 200 quantity of this material.

And at this same plant, one store, the location is one one.

And it is also required to Joseph.

Stupid.

Okay.

See, the entitlement scheme can see the details will be captured from the international data.

And if you go if you want to see the second line item details, either you can click on this and select

the second item or else you can use this button.

See, if you click on the next item, it will take you to the next item, see parameters before item,

so it will show you the details of second item 20.

And how much can be ordered to 120.

It's a valuation price will be taken from the metal master data and status.

If you come in after this Creation Opportunity Commission, if you create any purchase order with reference

to this participation patient, the status will be updated here.

How much can quantity order?

And this is called status.

We have some concept called release strategy.

Like whenever you order this purchase equation rather than recreate the creation, that aspect to other

person will needs to be approved this document.

So during that point of time, the status will show an end in release and if you release, the status

will be changed.

We will discuss this option later.

Okay.

Now click on check.

That means it will check whether it is having any issues with the system or any errors during the creation

of participation or not.

If not so, no messages should during check.

That means the document is good to save.

So let me save this purchase recreation now.

But this requisition was created.

The transaction code of 51.

If you want to display.

Emmy 53 and.

Orders if you want to drive.

Recreate it right in the screen.

At one end just now, we created we on to display immediately just click on this button then the.

We will be captured automatically.

You can enter so that it will display automatically in the same transaction or else you can go with

me 53 and down section and you can open it here.

In both ways.

You can do that, but change models so you can use 52 and transaction or else in the display itself

you have some option called display to change.

When you click on this button, it will take you to the change mode.

You are in this same transaction.

Move to an end.

You can display, you can change it, or else you can use the other transaction server.

52.

N 53.

There's a perverse dysfunctionality and I want to change.

Like, for example, I want not to 102 continued.

I will change this to 50.

And if we go to the valuation, it will show you the price changed.

See.

So it is a first line item, second line at 215 to 400.

Equal to one

seat is 2102 2002.

If you change it to 200, the value will be changed because the quantity and the total value price will

be reflected here.

See, it will go into change to four.

Sea change.

It will be calculated by quantity into valuation.

Let me save this.

So that our data will change.

People's education got changed.

And if you want to see the list of patches, requisitions have a transaction code called MI five.

This is the report.

You can display the list of parts of the equations.

We can use the plan.

Or else you want to go with purchasing group or material.

We want to use the date, the acquisition date, document date.

You can go with that.

Let me put this plan and click on Execute.

So it will show you the watch list.

See, this is the number for zero is it is having two line items C 1020.

Disappear number.

And this is the material number piston distributor or.

Okay.

You can see it like this.

And also.

We created this part of the equation.

Right.

See, next time.

Also, you want to create the same parties requisition with the same materials.

You want to create the same data again.

Again, that Joseph requires the piston and distribution order.

Again, if you have the participation number, then you can create with reference to dispatches or question

number.

Again, the same details will be fetched automatically without any manual work.

See how it works.

You can have some document already button here.

Right.

Click on this document already button.

Here you can see small symbol, like a button on one button is available, right.

Here you can see the small arrow symbol.

Click on the status symbol.

So that will show you some options here.

Here we can have like, equations and my particular equations.

My particular equations means.

Water pouches.

Locations we created will be displayed.

If you click on this purchase, my participation, if you click on this purchase requisition means if

you want to use others, other users created paths, you can go with this option.

Because I'm using I use it to create.

My participation.

So let me click on this my participation.

It will display the purchase equations, whatever you create it.

See?

See it issuing dispatches requisition because we created it.

My purchase requisition.

Let me click on this create button.

I mean, it will take you to the new creation window.

Okay, let me select the document type on the purchase requisition.

Okay.

Now I want to create the line items.

Earlier, we created the same here.

I want to create.

Just click on this.

And here you can see I'm selected here.

Here you can see the adopt button.

If you click on this add up button, what are the items available under this?

We are having two line items.

So these two line items will be copied here.

See, you got this button.

See the scheme details.

The same details were captured.

Okay.

This morning.

The delivery date is in the past, so that's the reason why changing it warning messages was disruptive.

See, the same details was copied here and if you want to make any changes, you can do the changes

and you can see.

Okay.

This is how we can create with reference to the old participation.

And also, if you want to, if you do not want both materials, if you want only one material, if you

want to copy only one line item, then do not select this particular creation directly.

Select which line item unit.

For example, I want to create with reference to this second line item.

So select this line item, second line item and you can click on add up.

So that equals copy the whatever data available in second line.

See?

Well, one item will be copied.

C Distribute loading is the second line item.

It is copied here.

If I want to make any changes, make the changes and let me take.

It's to make any changes, do the changes and save.

And we can't check so that it will check the if the person having an address it will display or else

it will show us like no message should during the check.

And now.

I'm saving this purchase requisition.

Okay.

See, the regression was created.

Now let us see.

Complete this stuff that makes good again.

See, it is having three personal four kids.

Four kids.

One.

For series one, having to measure two line items or series having two line items, but four e.g. for

series two, having only one line item.

And from here on, so you can directly go open the the equation.

Okay.

If you double click on this purchase number, it will take you to the purchase efficiency, double click

on it.

It will open the purchase equation.

If you want to open this part of the equation, double click on the purchase creation number so that

it will take you to the display of the purchase.

Okay, Joseph, do you understand how we how the users are creating the equation?

Do you have any questions?

No, no, no.

Okay.
