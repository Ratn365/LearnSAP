I think the current.

Today we are going to discuss about the autopilot process.

Last time we discussed it about it, like when we create a strategic question, we need to run some

transaction and then the people will be created automatically.

Right.

I told you yesterday or some other day something.

Yeah.

Did do remember that?

We have an option to create the.

Let me show you.

Yeah.

Yes, bro.

Let me share my screen.

They want to see my screen.

Yeah, I guess.

Colorado process.

We need to have a few prerequisites.

Okay.

Well, it means we need to have.

I the evil chick.

At Metal Master Data.

Okay.

And also, we need to have.

Part of your check it Vendor Master data.

And also we need to have what, in record.

It did vendor a metal combination and along with render cries of the material because the peel created

when we maintain the price.

Right, because we need to make that so we need to maintain one important code for the price of the

material which will be.

Paid to the vendor.

And also we need to have socialist.

But you need to have sources, right?

This vendor should be applicable for.

This material.

And then we will create a peer.

Okay.

We will create a purchase requisition.

When they come.

On leaving some transaction code for me if and.

This is the article we used to generate our top levels, but step is we need to maintain our typical

checkbox for Metro match and also demonstrate.

And we need to create one info record for this vendor and metro combination.

You need to maintain the source list for the vendor in the material and also we need to create a purchase

requisition.

Then we need to run the 59 transaction for this respect to be here.

Then the power will be generated automatically.

Okay.

Regarding the steps involved in our process.

At a guy's.

Hello.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Let us create a new matter.

Let us create a one united sector is.

Mechanical.

Machines.

So what has changed is standard.

Okay.

Just a plan.

Brandon adding, I think someone changed their standard configuration, but industry sectors have changed.

Okay, let's take one inspector.

And what is our metadata data right there?

The material.

Basic ones to choosing a contender can play this one better.

I'm not going to endorse.

What is the plan?

So many to maintain his command of.

And yet my continued take of

100% to be £50.

I'll

just drop.

Take one box.

Yeah.

In case.

Back to it.

There is a lot in.

Above it is useful variable.

Order it.

Hello.

In a purchase order, we need to convert automatically.

It will convert.

Yeah.

For example, I'd say if you feel every time you want to purchase on boxes, right.

Once or twice.

If you want to change any other unit of measure calculated metal master that level or else in the record

level, then we can change the purchase order.

That's the reason we activate.

This variable.

You can see that automatic pivot checkbox.

You can see.

You need to check this out of your option here.

The commenters.

And that's just.

Nation class artistic.

It's kind of like a this.

Okay.

Metal was created.

Some.

The data.

And let us take one.

It's good that the lavender.

Who then purchasing organization, purchasing and purchasing data.

I'm not creating new ones.

Let's shake existing, but here you can see automatic purchase object box.

We previously checked this box.

Right.

Automatic purchase order.

Please take this answer.

Okay, look, I think Bilal is the one.

Now, what is the next step?

The completed matter much greater.

We've taken one material and we take in Bilal as a vendor and utilize 15 inch gear and we need to maintain

an info report.

Smashing.

What is it?

You used to create a record.

It made one.

And told to change.

If you want to create MI 11.

MI 11, 11.

And given Bilal on 12 inch, 15 inch kerb material, which is inauguration Land Detail, a commenter.

They are not activated.

It is copied from metal.

Much better on box equal to five.

Just click on and it can deliver download state.

Necklace, ₹200 said we maintain our delicacy given for one piece.

And just.

Just sit.

So the record was created 21st century.

Okay.

In record.

Step on the computer.

Next, we need to create one source list.

What is the key to article we use for sources?

me0101.

Maintain the material and plant the contest

to maintain valid forms.

From today.

And very.

What was it?

It was the vendor.

Yeah.

Three quarters demand.

But only seven.

BP.

This fender is fixed because it's fixing this vendor, but this material.

It can't sell.

So we maintain the fix.

VENDOR Right.

So the socialist candidate feels completed now.

Let us create.

We are done for prerequisites for the art of your process.

Now we are going we are going to create a artistic vision.

What is the ticket to create peer?

Hello?

Anybody?

Yeah.

51.

And if the people we use to create beer and.

Select our.

Five.

What?

And just like any of us.

There wasn't going to be.

This one is easy.

Not a crook.

But, you know.

Here.

Okay, then let's see.

We can see that under such a source of supply tab, you can see a same source of supply.

You can see, right.

Yeah.

Just click on this of supply.

See below along with info Record number 25.

Have it caught us in, actually, because we maintain this vendor as a fixed vendor and as it is having

imported both.

So it automatically check whether there is there any source available in this system when vendors are

available.

Is there an IFIXIT vendor or not?

The system is checked and it's automatically ascending below.

Okay, you got it.

Hello?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Okay.

The van that was automatically saved.

Hello?

Yeah.

Yeah, if you like.

If you don't fix it, Surinder.

Yeah.

Then what will happen if you are saying so, you can see the second one.

The third one.

Yeah.

That is a wonderful lesson.

Like it automatically.

Yes.

Do we have to choose?

Vaccinators.

I will show you.

First, let let us finish this scenario.

Then we will go with the next scenario.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Yeah.

You got it.

Right.

How we, the vendors and the record caught us.

End in tears.

Yeah.

Good.

Again.

Well, let us see.

Okay.

Okay.

Let's see.

In state to state, crossing status are not they know the P was not roll out of your any other documents

or not created.

Okay.

Let us what is the next step after creation of.

One transaction equal to all this program people.

Let us remove and let us give only purchasing organization how many pills are available.

Just it automatically creates the purchase orders for purchase requisitions.

Actually, we have only one, but we are still not.

So this process can work to be automatically let us executed.

Click on.

It's cute.

See the error is by series four and part is all created successfully but is let us see how it got created.

Let me refresh it again.

See.

Bill got created.

Let us go to the speaker.

See, this is the people created.

Extremely scared.

How many we ordered?

Actually, thousand each aside.

Thousand?

Yeah, but.

But one box equal to five each.

That's why it's over 200 boxes.

And each one is one that is actually the metal match that we maintain as ₹200.

But in Africa we maintain one ₹8.

What is in Africa?

Number 25, right?

To go to right side.

You can see the incorrect number.

Fund created with respect to peer.

Got it right, how it got created.

Hello.

Do you have any questions?

I do understand that.

How the autopsy was conducted.
