Okay.

Today, we are going to discuss about the release procedure.

Are able to hear my voice and are able to see my stream.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

Today we are going to discuss about the release procedure.

Okay.

Actually, this procedure means it is an electronic way of document.

That is nothing.

But all in all, rather than using manual signature.

Right.

We use the approval from the manager level.

Right.

It is kind of approval for the purchasing documents.

Something like it is for recreation, but we are having different kinds of purchasing documents.

Write, purchase, requisition, purchase order contracts like agreements, contracts, scheduling equipment.

These kind of some purchasing documents will be available.

But the most important release procedure we use for parties recreation purchase order.

Mostly we use most of the cases we use.

Participation in parties order.

We also use in contracts as well, but mostly in the businesses.

Use this participation and purchase order.

Okay.

For stimulus in participation, a purchase order.

We are having two types of release procedures.

One is without classification.

So one is with classification and second one is without classification.

In with classification we have a for it can be related at item level or header level.

Okay.

In which classification.

And in the third classification, we are having only item level approval only.

It doesn't have any higher level in the configuration, but with classification we having it can be

related to Titan level or header level.

It is only for parties vacation only, but parties order.

It can be released only at header level only not at item level.

Okay, you got it.

Got it.

It.

Yeah.

And this can be decided whether it is item level or header level.

It can be decided at the earliest group level or else document level in both levels.

We can maintain whether it is an item level or header level.

Okay.

How you guys understanding?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Item level or header level.

This can be decided.

This can be decided at release group level or document type level.

Most of the companies I mean, most of the businesses, they use only classification, okay?

Because it has some flexibility with it can be go with item level or header level.

That's why they're using this classification concept.

Okay.

And without classification, it is only available for purchase, recreation only.

The third classification.

Conscription will not be applicable for purchase order.

It only applicable for purchase requisitions.

It was.

That requisition.

Okay.

I guess I understand what this means with the classification.

This is also used solely for purchase acquisition of a.

So sorry.

Sorry.

I didn't get to the point with the Subaru with bed classification and purchase requisition.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yes.

Whereas with classification means.

Yeah, it's it's not a different budget a lot better with the classification is also is important.

Yeah it's right it is also used in parts of the equation but with classification use it for either header

level or item level is possible for participation.

Okay.

But we third class item level means we.

Line item level means.

See, in paper we can order not only a single emitter, light multiple materials, we can create a positive

equation.

So if you are going with header level means the entire pier will be approved by a single person.

Other person, if it is item level means each item will be approved by other persons who are responsible

to approve.

They are.

Having the authority to approve an item level, each item level.

That is the difference between item level and header.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Yeah.

In any doubt below.

Yeah.

And before only having item level, not having any item level approval, it only had petrol level.

Why?

Because I will tell you, during the business transaction we are doing it like while we are creating

purchase order.

I will tell you why we are using only header level, not at item level.

Okay,

let's come to the configuration.

Okay, let's come to the configuration part we use to maintain the cab characteristics.

Characteristics means what are the characters we need to maintain for the respect to release strategy.

For example, let's say same classification.

Let's read this.

It's a definition for characteristics and classification characteristics.

Describe the properties of the objects.

The values of the six specify these properties like in characters.

For example, let's say Zoom document type is one character.

Okay.

Value is one character, but purchasing group is one character.

Plant is one character.

Right?

But choosing to augment having how many characters, for example, let's say it is having four, four

characters.

I mean, like document type is one character in that it is having a four figures character format is

for Z and B we maintaining, right?

Yeah.

Hello, Bella.

Yeah, yeah.

We're having a document type as one character and value.

For example, let's say if the metal what is greater than 50 K for example, less than or equal to 50

K, It needs to be approved by the assistant manager.

If it is greater than 50 K to one, it can be approved by manager.

If it is greater than one, then it can.

It will be approved by the purchasing manager like that.

There will be hierarchy levels we maintain for the each character.

Okay, you got it.

So the price will be the value read.

The value becomes the character for it.

And partisan group.

Who is the person responsible to procure this material will be one of the characters.

Our plan can be one character.

A purchasing organization can be a one character like that.

We can maintain under the configuration level.

Hello.

Simple simply appreciate the approach I set up rather to people based on characters, but I really with

a plot, whether it is the document I approach, whether it is a plan or whether it is a value which

mostly most of the business will go with the value along with document type purchasing group plan,

purchasing information.

Most probably they use value also, because if it is a greater than 50 K to one, it's tend to be approved

by.

Particular 30 person.

No need to again take it to the higher authority people.

Right.

If it is a low value, low value, then it can be approved by the like middle level or 30 person or

something.

If it is a very low value, it can be approved by the low level authority like that.

They will maintain like that.

Okay.

You got it?

Yeah.

So basically, this is for the approval type.

They are approval type characters.

What are the characters we use?

For example, if you if you take the price as a character, okay, it will be one of the characters

or else if you want to take it as a document, we can take the document type as one of the characters.

If it is a partisan group like that, we will take characteristics to A through the purchasing documents.

Okay.

Okay.

So let's assume like this these oral characters purchasing document.

I have value purchasing group plan.

Purchasing organization.

Okay.

These are called characters.

And we are defining so many characters under the configuration and we need to assign it to this one

class.

Okay.

And because it zero four, we use it to create a character of characteristics and class.

Class means we are assigning all the characters to the one class, which is nothing but a class like

it is having a group of characteristics clumped together and form it.

You got it right.

We need to ask them what are the characters?

We defined a layer to this particular class, and for this class we need to ascend 032 as a class 032

means it is called release.

Okay.

You got it.

That's not bad.

First of all, we need to define one characteristics, right?

Okay.

And the Catholics, for example, let's say.

What characteristics are available.

One is document purchasing, group purchasing organization of value like that for characters available.

These characters need to be assigned to the one class.

Okay.

But I generalization classy.

So these four characters will be as classy.

We got it right.

We are sending these four characters to classy.

And that lasted zero 3 to 0 three two mins.

Release release means release process, right?

So that's why we're assigning zero three to the decode we use to create this class is called zero.

Okay.

After that we need to define when release group release group will be assigned to the class.

Okay.

Let me take.

It is group.

In their central classy.

Okay.

So that means it is automatically sane to.

Glass characteristics also, right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

The little group assigned to class classes attend to characteristics.

So characteristics.

What are the characteristics we define?

It will be applicable to religious group.

Also, what is religious group means?

Religious group means like the group of people who are responsible persons, group of persons responsible

for releasing these purchasing documents with assent strategy, which is nothing but religious group.

Under this religious group where having the released goods sorry, release codes, release codes means

a process.

Okay.

We need to, as Cindy released quotes.

Release codes means a process.

Like I said, read assistant manager.

Just like the.

That's like phasing.

Man, is it?

But she hasn't had.

Okay, let's assume like this.

Okay.

These are called release codes.

Release codes are nothing but.

It's a process like the individual person who is responsible to release the purchasing documents.

Okay.

These release codes will be assigned to this release group.

What is the release group?

The group of.

Best possible positions to release the party's documents, which is nothing but release POC.

And it is indicative.

Release indicator means, for example, we created an purchasing document.

So release procedure is applied, then it will be assigned to one respect to release person to release

the parties involvement.

Right.

So if he releases the document, then the status will be stored as R, which is nothing but release.

Okay.

If it is not released, it shows as the status for block.

You got it.

This is called release indicator.

And the next one is called release strategy.

We need to define the release strategy for the project.

I will show you in during the configuration so that you can understand it better for the release procedure.

Okay.

You got it right under the plan people want.

Paradox of envy.

If the prize value is less than adequate, then it needs to be approved by assistant manager under plan

DP for document attendee.

If the price is greater than 50 K to one lakh, then it needs to be approved by assistant manager and

purchasing manager.

The levels will be created like this.

Okay, we got it now.

How the characteristics will be created.

These are called characters.

Document type is one character.

Plant is one character.

Val is one character.

Like that we can maintain the number of characters which are available in purchase recreation, like

quantity purchasing group purchasing organization.

We can take any character.

Okay, These are called characters.

You got it right.

What is characteristics means?

After that, we need to send all these characters to one class.

And also we need to them all these.

Release codes for approvals to release group and vaccine, both class and this release group.

Okay, you got it right.

How the configuration is created.

Do you have any questions?

What are we listening to?

Because, I mean, where do we release indicators, right?

Release indicators means we created one purchasing document like Guatemala.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

From parties in government created, for example, people created.

It is greater than all.

Now.

How many persons will be triggered?

These three persons, Right.

Yeah.

No.

About

whenever the person is improving, then only the second person will be approved.

Okay.

After that, the purchasing will be approved.

Right.

Yeah, they know the pillow is not approved, then the status will be showing.

SB block OC OC

is not approved till now.

It is showing SB when assistant manager is approved.

Still it is in only in block or state only OC.

Then partisan lenses approved.

It is still it is in lock step whenever the last approval partisan has disappeared.

The status will be changed to release then only the partisan document will be sent to the vendor.

You got it.

How?

The release indicator is different.

Why?

Yeah.

Okay.

Okay.

It is showing the status of the document purchasing document, whether it is they release it or not.

We can see the status in patches document.

It is called release indicator.

Okay.

You got it now.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Tell me.

Yeah.

Yeah.

No.

When configuration manager, character and manager position manager in all in all these three things

will be doing in the release group or.

We will create the release codes initially during the ascent after women during the assignment itself,

we will assign these 3% to the release.

While we are doing the configuration, you will easily understand how because it is a notepad write

you didn't understand clearly.

When we do the configuration, we can understand it better.

So let's us go with the conversation.

We share my screen.

She complained.

SB Adil.

Deckard.

Okay.

We are having results for participation and also for purchase order, right?

Let us do for the purchase order at a level approval.

You go to a materials management.

But choosing.

But his order.

And that this release procedure for purchase orders.

But you need two different characteristics.

After that, we need to assent to the release clause.

And it does create characteristics.

For example, people understood.

Document type.

Dr..

What is our contract?

DMV, right?

Concrete.

Description.

You want to step?

Okay.

But then you go to additional data.

Meaning to maintain the table name.

For purchase order.

We have a table called equal.

But initially we need to maintain sea communication for the communication.

We need to maintain sea level.

For many time.

The field name was B as B.

But then in this procedure we use the document type.

The feeling was bcr.

And that.

Format data taken from a dictionary.

Continue.

If you see basic data, we only enter the.

Description like story description, but it's automatically taking the number of characters from the

backend system.

And go to.

Values.

That here we need to give the.

Character value.

What is our document type D and B, Right.

D and B?

BMB means.

Delfi.

We will.

Descriptions are too complicated value.

They had given you no concept.

We just discussed the concept.

So we created one character for documentarian.

Let me remove this.

To see actress we maintain clear.

Yeah.

That document we use, we set.

I don't understanding that.

Hello?

Yeah.

Yeah.

These things are the standard.

I mean, are they standard to be set in?

Yeah, these are standard.

Yeah, these are standard.

Okay.

And let's take people value also.

We will value.

It's great people value.

Let us mention also Delphi so that we easily understand.

In between the concrete.

Go to values.

We need to give the description.

Right.

There is the.

People value and trust.

It's mandatory.

You can't.

Hmm.

The additional data.

I think it's not mandatory, actually.

Let us create, again, characteristics.

Create additional data, not give the payroll table name as equal, but value Z and meet W.

Okay.

And that's former data taken from a dictionary if you go for basic data one.

You can see it.

What is currency?

I am a right.

And go to the values tab.

Here.

We need to give the.

Values.

Less than or equal to 50.

50,000.

Or 50,000.

Second.s
