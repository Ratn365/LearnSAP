I given the character values less than Article 50.

Okay.

One character.

And under the values I'm giving greater than 50000 to 1 lakh.

And then.

One.

One.

Okay, Enter.

10,000.

Okay.

Less than 50 k.

There are 1050 to 1 lakh and greater than one lakh.

Okay.

Now let us click on Step.

What I copied to do so that I find characters stockman type.

And.

Find another thing called your doctor.

Okay people document type and let's create plant also.

Concrete.

The additional data.

I discovered that.

INSKEEP Phil Black, let.

Right.

And this.

And so our standards.

These are standards.

We take only these values

and values.

What is our plant?

Deep, yellow and red, if it is applicable for the plant.

Also, we can maintain it here.

Click on the.

I think I'll go to maintain the description of the plant.

Okay, We created three characters.

If you want.

If we want, we can create remaining characters.

Okay, let's take only three.

Okay.

These three, we created characteristics that are assigned to one class.

Go to class.

Like fish underscore just.

Why does Gloucester?

The

last I.

Release, but release strategy.

See 032, Release Strategy.

Click on Create.

Skip the name.

Tell Cross.

Moto characters.

The characters with different.

Item three.

Right.

This.

And.

People argue.

Thanks, Brian.

And that's.

One is called Duckman, the second one.

And I'm sorry.

The last one is called.

Not can't sell.

The class was defined.

Okay.

We defined one class.

What is the next step?

They won't release pressure purchase orders that can execute at least group.

On the list.

Reporters select this one, and if you click on Choose it is take you this and click on new entries.

It has created a new group.

Delfi release group.

Something like Let's give Daisy as release group, Delphi group.

Class.

It's a class.

And it.

Here it is, right?

Are three plus

cell.

And also, please see like this if we are if having any other groups.

This deleted.

Let me go back.

Let me show you that how that is going to go to new entries.

Daisy.

Class is our class, then.

Class the concept.

Candidate.

One group was created.

Okay, go back.

It's it it will be showing some longevity.

What is that message?

Please take check this class's release group or risk group.

It is only applicable for only one thing, but actually we define to release groups, right?

That's why it is showing some error messages.

So that's why we need to delete the release group, which was defined earlier.

So let's do this G1 release group.

But in real time we will create only one religious group.

You go back now.

It will not show the warning.

Now we need to define the release.

Okay.

On new entries.

What is our release group?

DC Right.

DC DS And when to give the release code, Let us give 01020.

I'm giving three approvals here.

The first chapter was

assistant manager and one manager.

But isn't.

But isn't.

And.

They defined the group.

And in that group we are saying we are creating these three responsible persons to approve the release

strategy.

Click on sale.

You can see, right.

Descriptions.

Go back.

We defined one religious group and we say we saying one class and we defined the religious groups and

we send it to the religious group.

Both cases were completed and released in the quarter with no need to define anything.

It's a standard functionality.

BLOCK okay.

And the report released.

Persistent failures and reasonable changes.

Someone had a meeting of this.

It's a standard.

It is also configured.

Okay.

Do not change anything.

Okay, let's.

Maintain as it is.

Go back.

And also, I will tell you what is this changeable means, which is having different kind of options.

Okay.

If I tell you right now, it will be a little bit confusing for you.

I will explain you this later.

Okay.

Let's go back.

Both release strategies.

Here.

We need to define these strategies.

Okay.

Click on new entries.

What is the release group?

Daisy.

Wright.

Daisy.

Please group

this class.

I think I need to finish the description.

It's okay.

It's going great.

Now.

Star status.

Click on new entries and give the release group.

Strategy one.

Let's give the chorus S1

four.

Strategy one.

Give the description like this.

Question What is the description?

Let's give it as less than a record to.

Care.

Listen.

Who is responsible for less than or equal to zero one only zero one assistant manager only.

Okay.

I don't understand it.

They love

the love they have.

Any doubts are clear, right?

Hey, Hasbro, Hasbro.

So we are defining now the release strategy.

This is most important.

Okay.

We need to give the release group.

What is the release strategy you want to create?

I'm giving the release strategy name as less than 50 K, but less than 50 K What the responsible person

to approve.

I'm giving us really Assistant manager only not adhere to consider four buttons.

Right.

Question is release pre request.

Click on it.

If it is one person, no need to do anything here.

If it is a multiple persons, then we need to do some configuration here.

I will show you that next shot.

Okay.

Click on.

Continue.

Click on release chart.

This one is called BLOCK.

Secondary is called.

Release BLOCK.

Continue.

Next, click on classification.

At.

Yep, we need to assign the values.

But it is this really.

What is the document type?

B and B, right.

Well, we can go for this.

How many documents we define?

Only one, right?

We assigned it.

What is the net value?

It is not.

We're just not taking.

Please select intervals also allowed.

Okay.

If I tell you, please click the interval several.

Consider.

You go back and come again.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

Okay.

Um, classification.

We need to assign the document and select this document.

Continue.

No total value underclass.

We are saying the characteristics, these three characteristics, right.

And that's why it's game for these three characters only.

And in character, total net order value, we assign three values.

One is called less than or equal to 550 K and remain two values also came up, but we are creating the

strategy for less than 50 k.

So I'm asking all these values continue and plant

plant once I say.

I'll go back.

The concept.

The process and applicant simulation.

It is just firstly taking part.

The concern is that the person is released, then it will be their release will be affected by this.

Okay.

This is just for testing purposes.

Let us create this second strategy we define for strategy.

Let us create.

Second, start the easy one.

Right?

Let us give strategy to.

Released to description and released to.

And it is.

Younger than 52.

One.

But this there are two approvals.

One is assistant manager.

Second person is purchasing manager.

Click on Release Prerequisite.

Here.

They need to check this second checkbox.

Okay.

How it is going to react.

Let me show you that.

Continue.

The display is exquisite.

If you check theory, it is pretty great for like this.

If first person and second person is not approved, then it is still in block or state.

If first person is approved, second person is not approved.

Still it is in block or state.

The first person and second person is approved.

Then it is in release state.

Okay, you got it.

It is called release Prerequisite.

First person.

After the second person, you check this second checkbox instead of this, it will be in reversal mode.

Let's see how it is going to see if have a second person then only for spell it is referring to first

for second person, which is not the character where it.

So that's why we need to check it here.

Not here.

Let's see.

This is like reconfiguring.

Go to classification.

That select document to be.

Just 50 to 1.

Below.

Back.

Sue it.

The less innovation the military is less checking, but the first person is really a double take on

it.

Still, it isn't blockbuster.

Double click on second one.

But then it is turned into released.

Okay.

Go back.

We created two strategies.

Let us create another strategy.

Easy street.

Under these three.

Rather than one.

But this the proof.

All three.

First approach needs to be done.

Message to manage the second purchase manager approval higher authority person who is purchasing head

needs to be approved.

Then only this document will be approved for purchasing from external vendors.

We can't release prerequisites that sell below.

CheckBoxes continue to list status.

Three did not approve.

Then it is in lock step.

We want a one April blockbuster blockbuster.

If all the persons approve approved, then it is introduced.

Continue.

Occupation.

And I sent the document type.

First of all.

Since then.

One lack.

Sandpoint.

Go back and save it.

It's going to be a simulation, but that's not how it works.

The first person is a approved.

Well, I could start.

Second person is a third person.

It is in the least.

Is working perfectly.

Go back.

So the configuration was completed.

You got it Right now the.

So now let us create a document how it is working.

Let's see it.

Okay.

Slash enemy on day one and to create a purchase order.

I'm creating manually.

So.

Bloodless surrender.

They do.

Beta.

Let us take off.

Grant the.

Listen.

The bill.

One plank seems to be the location.

10,300.

How much?

But let's.

Satellites.

Which means it is greater than one like, right?

Yeah.

Let's see.

The new tab disappeared.

Right.

In addition to the tab greater than one, that means who are the pros here?

Also.

Right.

Let's see how many eyebrows trigger for the start.

Plus temporary assistant manager's second place manager role is another person who is purchasing.

What is the risk group here?

Delphi Strategies Applied Strategy 300 is indicated.

It is in state, local, state, though it cannot be seen if we save it, but the fuel form will not

be sent to the vendor whenever the PBO is approved then only to be opened or else if it is a made then

only recourse to the vendor.

Okay, let's save it.

Now we consider.

Stuart.

Let's see.

See 3%.

Got it.

So when we created people, the mail will be triggered through workflow to the assistant manager.

Okay.

How it got there.

Actually, we have a user editor and a user 50 and actually in real time we are having shaker below

us like that.

The user will be okay.

It will be triggered to respect to email ID, so then they will see the email mail then.

So this is a poll we need to approve.

Then they will go to a API and they will approve how we are, who the responsible person will approve.

Let's see, there is a decode called.

Amit, 29 and.

Okay.

And me.

And is that the code we use to approve it?

You can enter.

The release standard article.

We need to approve this document.

Right.

But McCain's.

People took auto relish sexy.

You can see the small release symbol.

You can see right here that says Zoom, I'm the assistant manager.

I'm open this purchase order and improving.

You can't release.

That it is effective.

Let's save it.

C first person was an assistant manager was April.

Let's refresh it here.

C assistant manager was at the scene where the purchasing manager, as well as purchasing had also will

be approved.

By using this transaction, you can see that.

Then Partizan was released.

The status from B, It's changed.

You can see this.

This is how the other people will be approved.

The purchasing documents.

You got it right.

Is.

Adeline D'Amico.

As if many questions.

It is called federal level approval, because if it is having 100 line items, also the same person

will be assigned to the approval for in the participation.

The top level right per item will be triggered at item level.

At this point.

They got it.

Okay.

Tomorrow I will show you the item level approval for purchase requisition.

Okay.

Today, let's practice this scenario.
