Okay.

What is the manipulation?

Has it.

He here?

We need to give the number.

Right.

We give them little number instead of giving their number, instead of giving the participation, we

need to give participation.

Instead of giving participation, we are giving the metal number.

He is right at the manual creation of people without the reference to.

But there's a tradition for the era.

We do matters maintains.

And how much quantity.

But it says not a quantity.

Thank.

Is the baby girl still there?

Location.

This one, right?

Yeah.

This is how it can actually.

Based on the poor record, right?

Yeah.

This simple record created by.

Not us.

Actually, we checked the info, Right?

Yeah.

So that's it's created out of medical.

You got it right.

To click on check.

You can see how much of this.

And later actually it's configuration part.

I will explain you that also let's give you EU is the standard output that click can enter.

Go back.

And it was here to give your last local.

Go back now.

So back.

We can check.

So this issue.

Right.

So development is good to go to save.

Click on Save.

It is called manual creation of purchase order.

Let me show you another time the reference to participation.

Okay.

Plus we will create on purchased recursion.

Then we will do the purchase order with reference to purchase equation.

So what is the code we use to create parties?

Requisition.

5151.

And in.

Well.

Yes.

And here we need to select our document Z and Delphi purchasing requisition.

Right.

We define selected.

Okay.

And let's create a parks recreation for.

Create a new mantra.

For example, let us create a new a new method of.

Look, I'm not

maintaining a phone number.

Let's take mechanical engineering and metal type data.

Let's get on it.

What are the views required for purchasing this data over to designated purchasing Purchasing account

storage, Location one to location to location to continue right hunting.

Yeah.

Click on Enter.

We need to give the input for which under which plan we want to create this person.

Let's do the first material, second extorted location.

Then we can continue

and do exactly what is h What is the next material group?

What is the rate of it?

Let's assume

that it is 90 grams.

Okay, we can enter down under and purchasing in Domaine de la Chambre.

Pretty easy.

Deep, easy.

Okay, let us make do not enter in order.

Let's assume that.

In one box.

This is let's keep box in one box and I'm in a breakaway.

So let's take five requests.

Okay.

One box.

Okay, good.

Okay, Let's also maintain the socialist activation.

Okay, But this breakaway material.

Okay, let's see how it is working now and go to accounting.

You.

I got the name and the location of the violation plus 3000.

They could pass this therapist.

Robotic relationships.

Vanishing glass.

It is a bridge between our moment of integration.

We are preparing this material, right?

We are procuring others.

We are selling this material at that point of time.

When you receive the goods or when you send the goods to the customer, we are doing some good moments,

right?

Goods are coming into our inventory, right, So that their value will increase this inventory quantity

will increase as an inventory value also increases.

For example, let's say unknown quantity is came into our inventory.

It is zero, not total stock.

Then the inventory will increase it to 100 quantity and the value will increase to ₹150 equal to 55,000.

Right.

So the value will increase 0 to ₹5000 5000.

So value will increase right?

During the value increases some, it needs to be ten to the 13 that so on.

So transactions will happen.

Goods was received to the inventory you need to pay the amount of the vendor like that.

We need to tell to the finance team.

Right.

Okay.

Yeah.

So those are called generalized accounts.

It will hit digital icons for the reference of finance module so that they can clear the vendor accounts

by paying the amount to the vendor.

Either it maybe takes either it never cashed whatever the down payment transaction may be.

So when we sent this 3000 relation class in the background, there is a configuration, so they will

maintain some GL electrons there.

When we do the ghost movements, the respective GL accounts will be hit and they will know how much

quantity we receive, how much value we need to pay.

Okay, they got it.

Yeah.

The valuation class is maintaining here.

Okay?

Yeah.

Look.

That's why we are maintaining the values.

We are entering three this and 3000 there because we are having some standards in safety.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

So in order to keep this the standard, we need to maintain this 3000 here.

If you want to maintain if you are want to maintain some other violation for us, we can maintain also.

But we need to tell to the finance team that we do not use 3000 the value interest we need for a 4000

valuation trust.

So you need to configure to the 4000 that we need to tell to the financing.

Then they will configure it into the 4000 valuation, not 3000.

Okay.

Whatever we need, we can tell to the finance team.

So based on that, they will configure it just like we having some standard document.

And if you don't want it, we can go with customizations.

The end.

Likewise.

Standard.

Standard.

Okay.

Okay.

If you want to go with 3000.

Let's say I want 4000, then I will configure accordingly.

Okay?

Yeah.

The concept.

As the matter was defined, they were.

Let's go and create the purchasing equation for it and closing this.

Break required.

I want to order.

Let's say.

500.

Okay.

I handle.

What is the plan?

De Palma.

They plan to spend $1 purchased in APEC.

Or is that a conditional name?

Let's take a faker.

Wants it.

But choosing.

DLP MP.

I don't know.

FinTech unit of Mercer as each of the peer is creating internally, right?

So it takes only the each unit of measure not as box.

Okay.

Okay.

They required 500 units of break wise for the plan.

The one story location is one one.

Like that Dutch hacker is raising a requisition to the.

Which purchasing organization, DLP, purchasing, power, purchasing, automation, DLP.

Who is responsible for the to procure this material?

Bpg Purchasing group is responsible to procure this material from external vendors.

Okay.

You got it right.

Okay.

Yeah.

Now we go to the next level.

Okay, Let's assume, like, we already negotiated with the vendor.

We know the vendor's name.

Okay, let's.

He's doing that.

Yeah, we know that vendor name, right?

So let's give the ad fixer vendor.

Let's give it.

Okay.

Let's take a company quote, as demand.

I'm really not.

It has risen over and over again.

Amy Goodman.

Let's stick.

Howser is the biggest vendor.

Yeah.

If you know the vendor, we need to create an info recorder record and as well as straight.

Yeah.

You know, lavender and fries out the window.

If you know what, then?

We will create another paper with the future.

And let's say we do not know the amendment, but I will say I will do.

And the scenario that we do not know different than that.

So they will raising a requisition to procure this break with concealed.

See that here?

₹50 came, right?

Yeah, it came from Metal Master data automatically.

Yeah, it comes.

We.

This is a.

Well.

Yeah, actually, we can see the number, right?

Yeah.

So let's go and create with reference this recreation.

We activated source destroyed the activated sources, but we did not maintain the source list.

Right.

But we activated it.

But we do not maintain it right now.

So it will go through and it will the CCP system will throw another to us that in.

So at least you do not maintain any vendor.

So we can't create the purchase order.

Let's see how we react.

What is the best way to copy?

But on this level he is.

Yeah, we got this.

What we call this icon.

Yeah.

Select where you select to click on Aquarium.

Here.

We can see if we created the participation.

Go to my creations.

But if somebody created the part of the equation with compensated equation, that's a different return.

My hypothesis equations and positive equations, we create a particular question.

Let's click on the equations.

And here it will be displayed.

What are the parts they know we created?

Okay, so we can see dropdowns, right?

Three.

Beer.

How many line items are available?

It will show us if this year we are having to line items, but this year we have only one line like

that.

It is showing.

We are really created with the are already completed Lipstick Fire series two We created five series

to write.

Let's copy this.

Removing.

Glenda.

If they copy it is not.

Allow me to copy this fear.

First of all, initially we need to maintain the vendor first, then only we can copy.

I'm an adult.

You can see

the beer.

What is the material?

What is the quantity required?

100 boxes, actually.

How much quantity ordered?

500 each.

500.

Inmate Master Data.

We maintain this one box equal to one five, five, five inches.

Right.

Yeah.

I want breakfast.

So it is multiplied by boxes so that 300 into five equal to 500 each.

Right.

That's right.

Converted into 100 box.

Why?

It was converted in middle master data.

We maintain order unit test box.

Right.

That's why it was converted in 200 boxes.

Okay.

If we wanted not to order in boxes, we want order reaches, then the system does not allow us.

Let's see in here.

Yes.

I want to maintain 500 inches.

If I change it.

It does not allow me to change.

You can see my electrician, right?

We do not maintain any record right now.

You can see it.

It goes blank and it is asking us to maintain the net price.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Why it is not changing because in Middlemarch that it has, we do not maintain any control over there.

That in patches what you want to change, we can change like that.

There will be small control power in massive data.

If you activate it, then only the purchase order will have the ability to change from ordering it to

basing it on it.

I will show you that also.

Let's maintain the price for it.

We maintain how much quantity?

500.

A hundred bucks.

50.

₹50 for one box.

But each item it is easy to be four five into five.

25.

Right.

So convicted.

15 to 5 inches, Right?

250 Therapist Bad box.

They want to change it.

To not box.

I want to reach.

But it did not take.

To begin.

It is called per how much unit You want to maintain the place like that, we can maintain it.

We want to maintain per box that one box price we can maintain per one box price equal to two ₹50.

I don't understand.

What is this order Price?

It means.

Fat of London blogs.

They want to maintain each unit, then we can maintain it's 50, 50 degrees.

Yeah.

Yeah.

You understand it, right?

Yes.

Yeah.

And here we can see metal is not included in.

So despite socialist requirement, because in metal master data level, we maintain source list, but

we do not maintain any socialist.

Right?

Yeah, that's it.

Throwing an atom.

If you want to create the socialist, you can go to a01 transaction or you may use to create an easier

one for a socialist.

That's right.

Yeah.

We need to create our socialist creation.

So let's assume like this.

First.

Initially, let's create an info record and source list also.

Okay.

Okay.

Smash em.

What is the socialist creation?

0101 We can enter material on which Plan B, bl1 PL one.

Going economy.

What is the validity period?

Today's date is dated 27.

Anyone.

Is the no.

Let's take the love and the loss which is in.

No, no, no, not at all.

DLP and DLP was.

The LPO Staff Association was created.

It can allow us to create the purchase order 21 MN.

Maintain that the number.

My particular conditions.

Select our purchase participation and click on Adopt.

I'm.

It is again asking do not press because we do not maintain any info records till now.

Give ₹50 for each.

You can check.

Okay.

Because I'll sing for it.

I'll put my scissors.

Can I say this?

Let's kill us.

And you.

Selected to go to for the data.

I

actually go to.

Communication expert Got a communication method.

And here we can give a little seal.

Go back.

Go back.

Now click on check.

It does not draw any error message.

Okay.

Because we maintain the socialist, right?

Yeah.

And we created within the evaluative period that it is allowing us to create people.

Let's see.

I don't want to I mean, sometimes we created on boxes to this vendor and sometimes we created orders

in each as also, let's say.

Okay.

What else?

Sometimes you ordered in boxes, and sometimes you'll be ordered in bag ordering.

But the system is does not allow us to change it to the unit of measure like it is.

It does not allow us to create any chips.

Only on boxes we want to change.

Over here, there is a control in certain.

Let me show you that last.

Let's go to what is a decode.

Use it for change metric Master data.

And then 0002.

Give them a tail number and go to purchasing.

You

may be able.

After all, the unit, you can see small variation.

We can see.

Variable purchase or activate.

Let's click on this player, Bob.

Okay.

Okay.

If this is not accurate, please activate it.

Keep it as one.

No click on Sphere.

Now let's see.

Go to create the patches or patches or slash or 21

or the numbers.

But acquisitions which is.

Sneak on adult.

Gave the.

I want to change it to 500.

You just.

We can see that it's changed to 500 H.

Yes, that that's the control of this field Master data.

Okay.

That's why I'm not explained earlier.

A few other things also will be explained later.

Okay.

This part is part a key part is this batch management.

What is this processing and what is this post into instruction?

Stuff like that.

I will explain each and every functionality during the running of the business transaction.

Okay.

Okay.

The facts are, you don't understand it better.

So that's when I'm explaining the feels when while during the transactions of business, that it's easy

for you to understand.

Okay.

Okay.

Hopefully it comes.

How to create who players can understand RFID affecting will create digital.

Okay, We don't have to do anything with that, right?

We don't have to do anything.

We don't have any part on the platforms.

We have it.

We need to give the water the kind of electrons used, actually, that we give the animals that they

will create.

We have a concept called move integration during that topic.

I will explain you about that.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Do I understand it right now?

Yeah.

Let's go and create a dinosaur record.

I'm not saving these people again.

Let us create the input, and then we will save these people and close.

Slash Amy Dolan and me 11.

Okay

then the number villa Mr. Lambo Purchasing AutoNation RD, LPG.

Help you give the plan, click on Enter.

That year.

What is it you want to maintain?

We can maintain.

You can see that variable active also.

We want to want to change it to any other things.

We can change it during the purchase order.

If you don't activate the variable order, then you can't allow us to change it.

Okay.

Okay.

We to enter again.

It will take you to purchasing or dollars to two days, one day time.

That's 201 hundred quantity.

Boxes.

And what is the price per one each?

It is ₹40, right?

₹50.

Maintain the vendor in number.

Okay.

What is the transaction?

Could be used to change purchase requisition.

Pier 54 and 52 and 52 directly used to me 50 to 1 or else.

If you are in display mode, you can see a small spec similar display to change.

If you click on it, it automatically take you to 52 transaction.

Okay.

Okay, now show me 21.

N.

N.

N.

Nick has taken my requisitions.

I'm not rendering any vendor.

Okay.

You can't copy.

See.

See, Bilal also copied that initially what happened without the vendor.

The peer is not copyright.

Know how it is copied because we maintained in particular equation it is dated corporate PR.

Okay.

Do you understand?

Right.

Okay.

Yeah.

The price came up because we created a poor record.

All right, let's see.

Yeah, For record.

All.

On Pacific Ocean.

We can see the Pacific Ocean and move.

Let's see if these people.

Click.

Let me go to messages first.

But it does maintain an EU and go to communication method and then we'll go back.

Go back.

You can check.

Now click on See.

Now that view was created.

See?
