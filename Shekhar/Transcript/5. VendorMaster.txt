Okay, We are going to discuss about vendor master data.

Yesterday, we discussed the master data.

So today we are going to discuss about the vendor data.

What is the vendor data?

It contains the information about vendor for which the company or plant can procure.

For example, let me give you a small example so that I can understand.

Let me give you some.

If you want to buy a product from Amazon, let's assume it's a e-commerce store.

What we do is simply go to the website and choose the product which you want to purchase, and then

you place the order.

After that, the Amazon will send the goods to you.

Along with that, he will give you one invoice, which is nothing, but you need to pay a bill to the

sum amount of the Amazon file by choosing the product.

Right?

So here Amazon is the vendor.

And also you will be the customer here and you are placing an order to the atmosphere that some material

acts you're buying.

And after that, John sends you nothing but the product is delivered to you right after that.

Along with that, he will give you some invoices if you need to pay that amount to the Amazon site.

So here Amazon will be the.

Window if he is selling his own product.

Otherwise, what happens?

Some other people are also maintaining their products in e-commerce too, and they will sell their products

right in Amazon store itself.

So what happens?

Amazon will be the.

My main vendor here, but actually we're ordering to the seller who is selling the product.

Amazon is the ecommerce tool we are ordering through the Amazon, but here good supplier will be not

Amazon here because some people like some seller will maintain their products in the e-commerce store.

Whenever we wanted the product in Amazon, it will be sent to the actual vendor, actual seller.

After that he will send a cross through the Amazon transportation.

Or can we buy his own transportation along with the invoice which will be sent by the Amazon?

You understand the example, right?

Amazon is selling his own products.

And also what are the sellers people?

Outsiders also put their products in Amazon website and they will sell their own products.

So here what we had is, for example, in this example, Amazon is selling his own product.

Let's assume like this.

So Amazon will be the vendor ordering X or women's ordering at this.

Convicted on the

discarded necklace.

It says they are purchasing the Amazon product only.

Then Amazon will be done ordering goods supply.

And I think what she is will be.

Second

vice president.

Okay.

So it's mostly presented by Amazon because you are purchasing from the Amazon and also the seller also

being Amazon, but you are buying some product here.

The ordering at this may be changes, the supplier maybe changes, the invoice represented, maybe changes

the same Amazon if you just if you whenever you order some product it will be go to some bank location

headquarters let's say Amazon and Curtis's bank that says okay whenever you order it will go to the

Amazon address, but goods will not be goes up.

There can be Amazon or else some other person.

Okay,

same concept.

Let me take the same concept.

We want some metallics product.

We order.

When you place your order, it will go to the some ordering address.

It will go to some Amazon address.

Let's say that says let me take down.

Northampton.

Okay.

We ordered two Honda motors.

Some metal acts like some piston or something you ordered.

Okay.

But the Honda is not a good supplier.

It can be using some other distributor like Warren Motors or something.

The good supplier can be Warren Motors and also invoice represent.

They can be Warren Motors or else on the motors.

And also the vendor will be on demand.

It can be possible.

Right.

So this is how we maintain in my vendor master data, these are nothing but partner functions.

We call it is it partner functions?

Look, Joseph, you understand?

Do you have any questions here?

Yeah.

So we are all rising in order to the sum vendor and he is having some ordering address.

You need to order to that address only.

And then the product can be delivered from the same address or else it can be delivered from some other

plant.

It can be located either a the bank or something.

So which is nothing but a good supplier who is supplying the product to the customer, which is nothing

but a good supplier.

And also invoice represented.

I mean along with good supplier, he can be good supplier can be the invoice given to us or us.

Some other person can be.

Send an invoice to the company

on their inventory match data.

What are the type of data we maintain in middle market data?

What are the data we want and basic data?

One Purchasing data.

Some accounting data like metal price.

All these data we maintain as the same way in vendor market data.

Also, we have some types of data we maintain.

What are the types of data?

General data.

Which one is gender data?

Like in general?

What we maintain is name, name of the vendor address, door number, his postal code.

What is the address of the vendor?

We need to maintain that.

And that's.

And if you're just having any facts, duties on details, all details we will maintain

in general it.

The next data is.

The company coded

in company code data.

It is related to finance related data, like we maintain like bank account details, bank account details

and payment details.

On the general ledger account details.

Acceptably maintaining company data.

It will be maintained by a few people.

Don't worry about it.

These data will be maintained by their consultants.

The next data I use, but choose the data.

This data we maintain like payment terms.

Okay.

Don't like in good times,

like some minimum.

Minimum order value.

What other countries

would maintain this data.

I will explain that once we create the during the creation of randomized data, I will explain each

and every field.

So this is the type of data we maintain in the data.

And what are the types of vendors available in, as you see the first types of vendors?

Okay, First one is Fixer Window.

Fixing the maze for certain materials, company will be procured from ifixit vendors.

Those vendors are known as nothing but fixer vendor.

For example, some we have some pistons or bolts are not available.

Those matters only we only procure from these vendors.

Do not procure these metals from any other vendor.

Nothing but Ifixit event.

The next one is one time vendors.

One time vendors.

There.

We use it to order for a certain period, like once a month or once a year.

We procured the materials from the vendors who are nothing but one time vendors we told them is one

time vendors.

The next vendor is service vendors.

So that means whenever we request any services like painting the office buildings or cleaning the building

or these kind of like gardening every month and maintenance of the building, like cleaning of machinery,

parts, missionaries, this kind of services we procure from some vendors, right?

We are nothing but service vendors.

We procure these kind of services from the service vendors and the regular vendors.

It is like a daily basis procurement.

We procure the goods every day for the business, day to day transactions we use to procure the materials

from the regular vendors.

So these are the types of vendors we are using.

So now coming to configuration.

Here.

We need to define do.

Okay.

When I grew up.

And we need to assign the second group to number range, whether it is actually number range or internal

number.

We need to assign that account group to.

Number three, this is the configuration we need to do.

And also we need to do some partner functions configuration as well.

I will show you that in a step.

You understand the data part, right?

Do you have any questions here?

Joseph and I need any questions.

Yeah.

Okay.

One more time with that.

So these are called partner functions.

Whether like this partner functions like vendor or supplier and invoice representation will be the same

person.

Orders to multiple persons based on their business.

Maintain whatever the vendor is maintained.

Their partner functions will need to maintain those vendor matching data and types of data.

In these types of data we have, we need to maintain three types of data.

One is general data, then company core data and purchasing data.

I'm coming to types of vendors.

We have featured vendors for metals we procure only from those vendors is nothing but fixer vendors.

One time vendors, we procure the materials from once a month or once or six months or once a year is

nothing but a one time vendors, service vendors like we have some kind of services like painting,

cleaning of the building, These kind of services we procure from the service vendors, the regular

vendors, regular vendors is nothing.

But every day we buy the metal from the vendors and come to configuration part.

Now we are going to SFP and I will show you that recipe.

Conflagration gold SPRO transaction since I And you.

And.

Then we need to go for vendor.

First, we need to define the vendor Akan Group.

Okay, So the financial accounting group will be defined by finance people.

Okay.

Number ranges will be defined by us.

Financial accounting.

And go to account receivable and account payable.

And then go to their accounts, master data, and then go to preparation of creating vendor master data.

Here we need to define icon groups with screen layout.

Here you can see define icon with screen layout, click on Execute.

Here begins with some standard groups available, like vendors, see suppliers and invoice represented

by See we can maintain these partner functions as a different vendor sells, but then we use the multiple

vendors.

See ordering address is different and the supply is different.

Then we need to go with different account groups.

C ordering at this.

This is a standard econ group vendors supplier invoice represented by ordering entries.

See.

Under the mining order defined by the users.

Let us go and create one new account group.

Let me copy this and let me put some.

Z.

Is.

That is.

One vendor.

When the window.

St.

If you're creating a one time window, then you need to put the checkbox here.

And coming here you can see general data on record data purchasing data.

Just double click on it.

And here you can see at this communication control, these are call selections.

Like I'll tell you that which field is mandatory, which field is optional.

You can maintain that after creation of and I will show you this how we can maintain this required field

option in display after creation of randomized data.

You can understand it better.

Okay, I created one vendor account.

Now we are going to define the number.

See here you can see create number range for vendor accounts.

We can execute.

Let me see the intervals.

These are the intervals were created by the system.

So let's create one new.

Click on this so that it will show us the list of numbers that we sorted out.

This is the last number range was used by some other person.

Let me take it from here.

Steve from Sound City 2000.

Total consumer control button.

I knew entry in supply.

Let me put some number here.

Cities I would maintain a ZB.

Orders.

You can put that.

It's not a problem.

Let me put that.

Folsom.

2000 and.

So number range was defined.

Now we need to assign the account group to number range

itself, having a same number range to render account groups to connect.

What is our vendor account group?

The competition.

ZB Right.

BONDER When I found this and put our contact number range.

ZB

So we define the group and we assign the number range to it.

Now we need to do some other configuration because this financial accounting now go to metals management.

We need to define the partner functions, the ordering address to supply.

These are standard partner functions, but we need to assign that to our.

See that confrontation go to chasing.

And.

See here.

Partner determination.

You can see here, partner determination.

Go to this partner.

Determination.

Go to partner, Rose.

Here you can see defined partner roles.

Click on expert.

We already had this standard partner roles.

Question is VM is the partner function C VM vendor.

It is assigned to Ally.

LA is nothing but a vendor.

What type of partner type it is?

It is a partner.

Type two vendor.

And.

Ordering address.

It is a partner type of end randomized data.

Right.

And next one is is good supplier who is the supplier goods?

Sequencer player is a panda.

Prototype is then and second one is inversely presented by.

It is also related to when it does the standard configuration but not disturb anything.

And then define permissible partner roles per icon group.

We can execute.

So here we defined one action group, our vendor recon group vision.

And what is our recon group?

Z is.

The entry is not available.

You need to create a new entry.

Click on new entries.

What are the partner functions we are using being.

Would suppliers get this invoice represented?

What is our group?

XV is.

We need to assign this group.

Do department functions.

And this.

And this and.

And so it was a sign.

Now, see.

So what we have done, we define the partner roles.

It is having a some standard configuration set up, so it is assigned to our closest partner roles.

Now go to partner settings in vendor master record.

Here we have some partner schema which connects your defined partner schema.

Here we have a standard partner schema.

L1 vendor is the standard partner schema selected one partner functions in procedure can have a small

folder, click on it.

Here you can see the partner schema ordering address vendor and also some other partner functions also

available.

We use these for on vision vendor ordering Address IP invoice represented by Angie's cool supplier OC.

And if you want to define a new partner schema, you want to make changes in it thing to it.

You can do that also.

Let us go with the standard or else if we want to create a new partner schema, also, we can do that.

And also, I will tell you that no change and mandatory.

Mandatory means.

If you check this box to vendor, it means the vendor master vision is automatically assigned during

the creation of randomized data.

There is no manual entry.

It is a mandatory partner function and coming to no change means if you check this box then.

The number will be assigned automatically.

It can't be interchangeable more.

It is in display more.

During the creation, I will show you that how these controls work.

Let's assume it is only checked for vendor.

Let me do one thing.

I will check for good suppliers and also must be presented.

And I'm checking this.

Okay, Sam.

11 partners came.

I will assign to our vendor control assignment of partner schema to account.

What is our account group XV A-Z.

Here you need to assign the partner scheme.

Disband the new ascendant.

Okay, so the configuration part is completed.

Now let us create the data.

So for data, we have a transaction codes.

But creation, The code is executable.

But change The code is exit zero.

For display.

The default is x zero for the list of windows.

The default is empty.

Visit pen is a central creation.

That means I already told you that we have three types of data.

One is general data.

Second one is complicated data.

One is purchasing data.

Gender data will be defined by us or else Finance department company core data will be filled by finance

department, but using data will be defined.

But.

Our job consultant.

So that is the reason we have a multiple transactions here.

Zero one is first and I'm consultants.

Yes.

Zero one is for finance consultants to maintain individual.

Let's see if people want to maintain only company code data, then they will use this transaction that

can determine if people want to maintain only purchasing data, then they will use and if board wants

to maintain, then they will go with text, digital CRM and.

Yeah.

See.

I told you that, like, General Data will be a reference to both finance consultant and consultant.

Okay, so.

It can be defined by I mean the data will be entered by a consultant or else finance consultant.

The company core data will be.

Maintain by consultants and purchasing data will be maintained among consultants.

So if they want to maintain individual data among consultants, we will go with zero one and have a

consultant equal with them.

That's the reason we're having multiple transactions for the vendor data and.

Whenever we create both the data, then we will go with zero one.

No, let us be it.

The vendor Master Data.

Now let us create the event to record the transaction we use x01 and this is the initial screen of creation

window here.

We need to put the company code.

What is our company code?

It's Mark Quantum Motors Limited.

Right.

And then purchasing organization.

History people.

And I can't group the tree.

Is it?

I about.

I can't.

Okay.

No, We are using the internal number, so the number will be assigned automatically.

Do not maintain any number here.

Now click on Enter.

So sorry.

Not busy and.

Because an internal number, once we created the number, will be assigned automatically.

Let me put as some domestic vendor.

I'm giving some name here.

What, Marcus?

I it's a company c c

support.

Quite a bad country.

Isn't.

Isn't.

It's nothing but estate and English.

Some telephone number.

This is address details and that.

Stamatis.

Let me some.

The same solar.

And this data will be maintained by the people like bank account details and all of the things we don't

require to maintain and which is also maintained by the peoples.

Well, here it is a mandatory piece without maintaining this data.

The system won't allow you to create the amendments that will be required in the reconciliation account

as domestic

table.

Domestic.

Let's take this and pull the cash management group.

As domestic.

Because we are buying from the local vendors.

So we need to put as domestic and payment terms, payment terms.

What do you mean by these payment terms?

Payment terms means vendors will give you some discount on or before we done a payment of deadline of

the actual payment date.

I see.

Because the vendor is giving us some discount, like.

If you pay the amount of the goods to the company, if you pay the amount within one month, I will

give you some 1% discount.

If you pay within 15 days, I will give you some 3% discount.

If you pay within five days, I will give you some 5% discount like that.

He will tell some payment downs because the company will procure in bulk and payment will be done in

after one month or after two months.

That is the reason the vendor will put some payment context to date.

See here, if I click this button it will show some payment terms.

See it is immediate payment.

So you commit to this.

If you pay within 14 days, I will give you 3% cash discount to pay.

Within 30 days I will give you 2% cash discount like that.

The vendor will give you some discount.

That is nothing but a payment.

So let me take some standard double one, please check this check double check invoice.

I will tell you what is the functionality of it during the creation of invoice receipt.

I will tell you that.

Just check this box.

Enter.

Because it is used for the check, is used for duplication.

It will control the duplication of documents.

I will tell you once we create the invoice receipts.

And see, this is a position that it is very important to us, see our currency.

What is a vendor, our currency.

He's a local vendor.

Then you need to put all the currencies and if it is the other countries vendor like he is from us or

something and put the other currency that used the same terms of payments here.

What does it all mean?

In terms, what do you mean being what it is mostly used in import procurement.

And also local vendors also put some important conditions.

For example, let me give you a small example.

Like they may say, like, for example, they miss the vendor will say like he will transport the goods

near to the port area.

After that, the company will need to take care of the remaining transportation like that.

The vendor will tell you some transportation related terms and conditions, which is nothing but incorrect

and no more value like how much minimum order you want to procure.

You need to maintain that schema.

Group Vendor It is using pricing processes.

We have a some pricing procedure concept during that.

Topic.

I will explain that this came up at in group on the remaining features of the salesperson.

If the vendor is having any sales person, we can maintain that here.

And telephone number is telephone number.

Please take this chair based I.D. and that clause is required.

And now click on Enter.

Now, see, these are called partner functions.

Ordering address vendor invoice presented by and we define right.

See, the number is automatically assigned here.

It can't be changeable.

See?

Can be changeable.

Right.

See all our Vern models.

Okay.

Why?

Because in configuration.

We put.

There's no change, Right?

That is the reason why.

It can be changeable.

Let me create another window.

Then you will be understanding better.

Let me save this window.

See the randomizer has created.

Okay.

Splash ten x kit 032 display isn't the same in the number.

Address details, photos.

All this has all the data and see this is the vendor we created.

This is the vendor number.

See you reconciliation on terms of payment data and partner functions.

Now, let us do one thing.

Here's the vendor, right?

Now let us go and do the second one.

We've done this one in this part is completed because all these same vendors let us go and create Honda

motors.

I mean, Warren Motors is the good supplier.

What we do is we all define the modern models, right?

That says I'm very is the.

Sublet.

Sublet.
