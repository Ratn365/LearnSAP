And it is the most important cycle in CPM.

Once you understand the P2P cycle, then you can easily understand most of the relevant topics in CPM,

just like it is the backbone of CPM.

Okay.

As we know that we discussed earlier, right, As we know that various departments work together to

reach the goals in an organization in order to fulfill their common goals.

So it needs some materials or services.

For example, any department let's take let's say production department requires raw material to produce

finished product.

Likewise, any department needs their individual requirements to fulfill their goals in procure to pay

cycle.

The following steps will be involved like determination of requirements, Source determination.

Vendor selection.

People processing.

People monitoring goods received, invoice received and payment was OC determination of requirements

like for example production department requires permits right to produce finished product like or.

So it is nothing but determination of requirements and source determination for procurement of these

raw materials.

We need vendors to buy these products, so we need to determine the source to procure.

And another thing called vendor selection.

There were several sources available at outset, but we need to select from that list based on some

parameters.

Offender.

We will create one purchase order to the vendor to procure the materials.

After that, we will monitor, like, just like we track the purchase order.

After that, we received the goods from the vendor to our inventory.

Along with the goods, the vendor will send you an invoice received.

Based on that, the finance department will pay the amount to the vendors.

Is it clear?

It is just like outline, just look into the document flow of P2P cycling ASAP.

The department determines the requirements and approach to the responsible department purchasing department

to procure the materials or services.

That is to create an internal document called Purchase requisition.

Once the determination of requirements like raw materials the company manufactures or orders the diameters

like engine shafts or glass steel.

There are the some kind of raw materials, right?

So they will rise in one internal document, which is nothing but the purchaser to the purchasing department.

After that, the responsible department tried to search for source to procure these required materials

or services.

So they will request a quotation to.

External services.

I mean, like external vendors.

So.

And also they will maintain some quotation deadlines before the deadline.

The condition needs to be sent to the company by the external sources who are nothing but vendors.

And they will convert those quotations along with the quality of the product and delivery time of the

vendor or payment terms, And they will select the vendor to procure these materials by the purchasing

department.

And they will compare those quotations along with quality of the product or delivery time of the vendor

and then they will purchase.

These materials by the purchasing team simply say they will rise on purchase order to the vendors along

with the quantity and delivery date when they want.

Then the vendor will deliver these goods to company.

The company will place the goods in the required storage location and then the plant.

Once the process is done, they will proceed with the invoice received and it is relevant to the finance

department.

In this received they will mention the payment terms.

What are the taxes available in it?

And all these bills will be available.

Once the receipt is done, invoice is done, then the vendor payment will be performed.

But

payment was not relevant for them.

It will be Take care of the finance team.

Okay.
