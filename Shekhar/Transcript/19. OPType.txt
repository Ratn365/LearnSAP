Today we are going to discuss about output type determination.

Let me log into the supposition.

Let me open on the table.

Yeah.

Yeah, this is the patches.

We created a layer, but we created an escape system.

Right.

How the vendor will know about the purchase order.

We need to send these people to vendor.

Right.

So that study is and what we need to do one configuration called output determination.

Okay, head here.

It will.

We can send to fax or we can send through external send email.

EDA I mean, like EDA means like a system to system transfer.

Like that would have some kind of medium side.

You can do a printout from the safe system and we can send it to physical document.

We can do.

We can use any of these medium to do output determination for sending this purchase order to vendor.

It is called output determination.

We need to do an integration for this output type.

We're having different types of outputs.

The standard output type is an EU.

Okay.

We're also having different types of standards, but we use only an EU as the standard one.

But.

But yes, but our request that we are having several documents that like request for quotation purchase,

requisition, purchase order and as we have some contracts, these are all called purchasing documents.

All these documents having this similar procedure for output determination.

But purchase order is very important for them, right?

So that is a reason why I will tell you about the procedure for purchase order remaining purchasing

documents also similar to same as it is.

But forgetting this output determination.

We need to do some configuration activity.

Let me show you the.

What is that could be used for configuration?

Spirit.

Sparkle cep reference img.

And go to Mattel's management.

Output and determination.

We are configuring for purchasing documents.

So go to Parcheesi.

An.

At here.

You can see messages, right?

Go to messages because in purchasers, if you go to messages only, the output determination will show.

We'll see.

So go to messages.

And here you can see output control.

Go to output control.

Here.

We need to define condition tables at the sequence nurses types and assess determination schema.

Okay, let me take.

The safety.

Already had the.

Standard.

Condition tables.

C Condition Table four Requested Quotation Condition.

Table four Purchase Order Condition Table for outline Outline Agreements Outline Agreement is nothing

but contracts.

We have a topic called our clinic.

I will tell you on that how we are going to create contracts between vendor and the company.

And as we are having some scheduling agreement between vendor and company.

So now let's go and.

See the what are the standard tables are available for purchase orders.

You can execute.

If you want to create new one, go to create.

If you want to displace existing tables, go to display.

I'm going for display.

So click on the square bar.

We can see the list of standard tables available.

So you document a particular document.

See, we defined some characteristics for release strategy, right?

How the strategy will trigger based on the combination we assigned in classification as the same way.

What are the combination we maintain in condition table?

Based on this combination, the output will be triggered in purchase order.

Okay.

You understand?

Did you remember how the strategy will trigger based on the combination?

Right.

Is the same way is the same way When the combination is matches the output that will be triggered in

purchase orders.

Let us take a few.

Take document.

The content you can see purchasing documentary.

There's one field.

Go back.

Let's see another one.

An autistic purchasing organization and a vendor, the contingency purchase automation vendor combination.

Then this purchasing organism and recombination came in purchase order.

Then the output that will be determined automatically go back.

If you want to create any new condition tables we create from here create condition table.

But let us use the standard one.

If you want, you can simply create a new table.

We already had the standard tables.

Right.

Let us use the same tables.

Go back.

So.

In two different condition tables.

Access sequence.

Okay.

Access sequence.

Well.

Close this condition tables.

Go to access sequence.

Define access sequencer.

Purchase order.

Execute.

Here we can see some of the action sequences, right?

But the standard as a sequence is to build your over selected go to access.

And here we need to assign the tables in condition tables.

We having some standard tables, right?

The 0 to 7 is the table 0 to 5, 0 to 6 is the standard tables.

See what is a 0 to 7 table.

Having the combination of purchasing recognition render.

We need to assign it here and document type.

What is our vendor and document?

We want to maintain another table so we can maintain here.

It is a standard one, right?

If you want to create a new access sequence also we can maintain.

If you want to enter a new sequence, let us copy.

On the tables it is having let's see, 2725265.

Let me check any other table available.

Have.

With the condition of disorder display.

So these three tables used.

25.6 .76 files.

Except fair or zero to.

To see Prince.

Let me copy this.

Then the access sequence.

Just.

Copious.

And just.

It's copying the table entries.

Entered 49 entries available selected for the access C, which is having 2526, 27.

What are the tables we see?

29 and 635 Let us send those also entries as a table.

But let's take it off the table.

029 29 table.

And 35.

Any number can give any serial number 31.

It's not a problem.

635.

It is choosing gold and other combination also as.

You can't save.

And gas.

And gas.

It was there.

Well, that's.

Set up six different countries.

And those.

See those files are also signed automatically and just click on Save.

See, by the standard 0001, it is having only three combinations.

But I sent another two combinations to the our access sequence.

I have to sequence for Stefan The HQ.

Delphi sequence.

So we defined one as the concert.

We define condition tables.

All these can be condition tables as assigned to.

That's the sequence.

Now, this access sequence needs to be assigned somewhere, right, to use these combinations.

So.

Clause.

This condition labels go to message types.

Message types means output types purchase order.

Here.

They can use the standard output type, right?

Execute.

Maintain message types for people.

Go to my message types for people need you is the standard.

We want to choose another output type so we can define a new one.

They're testing the new available.

Well, someone created the new look.

No problem.

Let us.

A standard one.

We use standard one selected.

Click on details.

See here.

You can see access sequence, right?

If we ascend our access to fence, then when our combinations will came up, this access sequence were

defined by some other person.

So let us remove the access sequence.

Ask right into the queue.

And just.

Default values.

We are having dispersed and each number having different functionality like output type sticker.

After that, if you want to send a printout, I mean, like send the mail immediately.

Or if you want to take the printout immediately, we can maintain this for.

Not if you want to do it on transactions like after saving the people.

We are having a transaction code called M.F..

When you run that transaction, only then only we can take the print out of the platform or the mail

will be sent to the vendor.

These are all happen when we run the transaction.

And also we are having some job of sort of a maintained in the background system.

So then the background jobs are running, then the people will be sent to the vendor automatically.

This is how we maintain the configuration output by getting maintain for adoption, send immediately

and the let's take print out option.

Now, if you want to maintain any other things because we don't have the functionality for the test,

the test server to send the mail right, right now.

So let us make it as a print.

What are the partner functions?

We need to send it to the vendor.

That is what we maintain as a vendor.

And remaining things are not much important for us now.

We maintain and also we need to check this access to conditions because we are creating some condition

records to get the output type that are mine in the people.

I will show you that how to create the condition because that is the reason why we need to check this

access to conditions and the multiple issuing multiple issuing means like you created a pool, right?

You take the printer after the printer if you want to change anything in people.

And we want to issue another plan after the changes, you need to select this multiple issue.

And these are the standard programs and routines.

You need to assign it here, like change output.

Like if you do some changes in the people, the output will be determined again.

So that's the reason we change party in the output.

There will be one program, standard program.

It needs to be sent here.

Okay.

No need to change anything.

Just time.

Change.

That's the sequence here.

Go to mail texts.

While during Clinton we have some title, right?

So the title is the standard title is New Purchase Order printout based on the language which it has

maintained here you want to see the English see new purchase order or printer.

It's a title longer processing retains.

See it is something related to technical things like adapting will maintain the smartphone.

What is smartphone means?

Let me show you that.

Click on print preview.

We are getting some form, right?

This is one form.

This form form.

It will be taken up by the above team.

See, the address will be maintained at right set of the form and we need to have the logo of the company

here.

Like are some forms will be created by the technical team.

So that form needs to be assigned here.

Okay.

Based on the business clients requirement, they will give some form to the amount people.

So we need to guide the technical team like above team.

Here we need to place the logo.

Inside.

Should be like a 4x4 or four button like that.

We need to tell the above.

So right said get here.

We need to have a vendor address here.

We need to have a company address like that.

We need to tell to the technical team then.

The technical team will create some smart forms and they will give it to us.

Then we need to send it here.

Okay.

If you want to take a printout, we are having some fun.

If you want to send through, fax, send to send the system to system transfer.

If you want to go for mail on early processing.

Different kinds of mediums are available.

Based on that, we will define some smart forms and we will assign it here.

Okay.

Partner roles.

Partner roles means we discussed in vendor master.

They have some ordering address vendor, good supplier like that.

We have some partner roles, right?

So those partner roles, if we want to send anything we can maintain here.

Okay.

Do not change anything and just change the access sequence.

Okay.

I changed all that to see its combination.

Go back.

Then go to fine tune control.

Okay.

Here we are having new.

Unchanged.

Unchanged.

What is our output?

And you write.

I created the people called New.

So the print was formed here.

But if I wanted a print again, what are the changes I done in people?

I mean, if I change 100 to 200 in messages.

We are getting another output by.

Fanfic books that can see change, right?

Change messes that another output will be data in mind here.

Second, as a second line item.

Second line and it will show you like change checkbox.

And we are getting another print out here.

That is the reason why we need to maintain one for new and.

One for change.

You can see two times it is available.

And EU and EU.

The go back.

Was it?

This is how you maintain these types.

And go to message the determination schema.

Go to Macy's came off a purchase order.

Maintenance says recommendations came up Purchase order.

The adhere.

The standard procedure schema is odd and the.

Selected go to control data at here.

We need to maintain what are the top message types.

We want to get in purchase order.

Okay.

The new.

Where is the new artistic?

See any of here.

It's a requirement is print.

We need to tell the system it is a print.

Okay.

This is God and you.

If you are to find any customized message that we need to send in this procedure.

R&B or if you want to go with the new procedure, you can create a new procedure and you need to send

the.

Condition type.

Condition type is not input output and go back.

What else?

Do you have any confusion?

Let me create a new one so that it is easy for you.

If copy.

C.

I would.

In fiscal.

Well.

Content is copied.

No, Let us click on scale.

Okay.

So let it go to control letter.

You don't want remaining.

Things.

Don't do it on us.

We don't want to.

Xenu.

Let's remove it.

I need only you.

We even made.

You don't want anything, just ignore it.

And say, what are the output types you required you need to maintain here.

Now we are confident only for a year.

That is the reason why you maintain any reminding.

These are standard.

So let me keep it as this.

Go back.

Essence cannot purchase order adhering to us in our procedure.

Yes, Hitch.

Click on sale.

Here.

It means purchase order.

Application of Miss.

Purchase Order.

Purchase order.

Demon's output.

See women's output.

So we are saying our procedure here.

Save it.

Go back.

Okay.

This is the configuration for output type determination.

See.

No.

I need to create the condition record first because we maintain the combination.

But what are the formulations we want to trigger?

We didn't maintain, right?

Which one?

That it needs to be triggered like that.

We need to maintain it.

We need to define the condition records for the output determination.

There is a transaction code called amp zero for.

Create conditions, records, output conditions, records.

What is output type?

And you write you're using.

Under new.

How many combinations we maintain access sequence.

Does he want?

What is our exit sequence?

This is right.

Is.

One, two, three, four, five, five.

Combinations.

Remainder.

Let us see.

One, two, three, four.

First combination is.

But either way, when the second one is documented by porches or windows, see Windows Media.

Next is documentary purchasing a documentary purchasing nationwide Wilmington company Portland, which

is information for which combination you want to create the conditions for it is asking.

So now let us go with the purchasing organization vendor.

Okay.

But she didn't want to continue.

That here we need to give the document.

What is the document that we are using?

It's a document that.

We get fined.

I will be in Vegas.

Denver, Right.

Of any domain or DMV.

What does the document we want to give?

What is our purchasing or the.

Beaver.

If the was.

The be repurchasing and let's take as it is, the vendor.

I'm taking only for Hazzard, not for Bella.

We tried to clear both of them.

Let us see how the system works.

Function.

What is the function when under the android?

Automatically taken.

But as a medium we are using print out, right?

So one aspirin to.

And dispersion of the dispersion we're using for immediately.

Languages.

Yen.

English.

And that.

Let us save it.

Okay.

Condition record was here.

We want to display it.

The transaction code 106.

Display of poor condition reports.

The second commissioner said it is a display for the Coalition.

Let us go and create one.

Let us see how it works.

And I to give the.

And that is the window.

And but choosing Augusta only and choosing not to the people.

DPG.

Being locked.

Delphi motors.

And just given the data he here's.

And these are.

Mr..

I'm not going to be on this one.

Necklaces, yellow textile material, plus maintaining the commercial delicacy.

500.

These.

That's good to hear.

That's why.

Okay, you can check.

Let us go to messages now.

See the new triggered automatically.

Right?

We do not send anything.

It is.

Determine automatically.

No.

Go and see it.

I'm opening it for the naysayers.

Still in one read because we need to mention some.

Think all the.

Go to change for.

The messages.

So go to communication method.

And doing that.

Let us at least.

Then go to the crater.

Or send an assistant immediately and go back.

Oh, I think we created with envy document that that is the reason why it is not taking creating over.

Industry standard.

They're testing the material.

Quantity.

And the location.

Check.

This is.

Right.

Let me check the configuration once.

But this changed once.

Communication.

Okay.

So I look.

Yes.

Relevant.

It is.

I love them.

Just like.

Let us do it again.

Could you could you please return again, guys?

I think this session will end.

Hello.

Okay.
