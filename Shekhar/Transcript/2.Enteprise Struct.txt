Yesterday, in the last session, we discussed about the political part of enterprise structure or how

the structure will be looks like.

Today we are going to do this.

Today we are going to do the consolidation for the infrastructure.

So this is the CPA.

Let me log on to our server.

See, this is the home screen of SAP, which is nothing but recipes axis.

Here we can have a configuration navigations.

Here this folders is navigation for shortcuts instead of using the transaction codes.

Here you can see the small command box.

It is not, but the command box, as you already know about it, like your end user.

There we can enter the transaction code to clear the transaction data and also the master data as well,

the configuration data.

So this is the main part where we can do the configuration activity by using these parts orders.

We have a one transaction code called SPRO, where all the models, not only m s, t w what are the

models available say if they want to do any configuration activity, the transaction code is SPR.

And here we need to click on see P reference.

I'm the I'm Jimmy's implementation guide.

We call this button.

So that will show the list of configurations.

What are the configurations available in the.

Configurations?

All the models, not an EP.

Um, w what other models are available in those conditions?

All are available in this same transaction.

Okay.

Today we are going to do the entropy structure configurations, right?

So here you can see the entropy structure.

Here you can see small dropdown button arrow arrows showing right, set, right, Just click on it.

It will drop down the remaining inside configuration.

And then let me open the answer so that you can understand it better.

See here.

You can see right down to structure.

This is the structure of Emma.

Initially, what we need to define, we need to define just so we can see the screen.

Right.

It's been.

Sorry.

You can see, right.

Hello, Joseph.

Guys, I should go.

Okay.

See here, initial what we need to define.

Like, what is a structure here?

Purchasing, organization, plant and store the location.

This is the structure for Amazon plan.

But yes.

So in order to do that, we need to have a company and company code as well as controlling area.

These will be defined for people, but it is a test server, right?

But in order to use the assignments, we need to create that in test server.

But in real time we don't define those.

So let me define the company.

This is all go to definition.

First, we need to define those right and good financial accounting.

And here you can see defined company recon.

I'm in here you can see small clock symbol, right?

It is nothing but the execute button.

We call it as a execute button.

Click on that execute button.

Here.

You can see so many companies available.

If you go to town, you can see because it is a test server, so many people were creating their companies

and they are practicing.

But in real time, these many companies, you can't see what are the company?

They can't meet the clients.

Company can see that only.

Right.

But it is a test server so many people are creating there for their testing purpose.

They are creating their companies.

Now we are going to create our company we call new entries.

Here you can see what is the company's everything.

How?

Some code.

Okay, We need to maintain that code.

For example, we're creating a company called Let's zoom on the company on the document and it's like.

And automate its name and description.

And what is the st St?

What is the st?

Let's give me some st like.

I'm speaking of.

I'm giving and postal code.

Let me give it as a.

Let me give you some code of

ethics, okay?

Here is how bad it is.

Let's say the Honda Company is located outside of country India.

Right in.

He spoke India language.

Let me give us English and currency.

What is the currency of this company if it is looking at us?

Its currency is based on it.

The currency will be added.

So let me give us INR.

Indian rupee.

Okay, If you don't know the code numbers, you can see every button.

It's having a small square button you can see.

Right.

It will show you the list of currencies.

It will show you the list of languages.

It will show you the list of cities.

Based on that, also, you can select.

There you can see the list of currency sort of available.

You remember something like Indian rupee.

If you want to locate it, you can see a small fine button here.

Click on it.

Lets me enter India and it will be giving you 2000.

Having some India.

It can get rupee.

He found out the Indian rupee.

Who set?

We've gone end now.

Save it and never you save it.

The system is asking one transported.

See here.

Save it.

It is asking the one transport request.

Here it is already defined one transport request for another company.

Okay.

Why?

Why this transport request or customizing request?

It is called is a customization request.

We call it is a transport request.

Okay.

Why?

It is asking?

Okay.

I will explain why the dealer is asking every time.

If you do the configuration part, we have a separate session for this.

Just for your understanding.

I will tell you for simple line for this.

Like whenever in real time we will develop something in a system if we want to move it to the client

system.

Okay.

This year, whenever we move this to number two client system, what are the changes you have done?

What are the configurations done?

It will be moved to the client system.

That's the reason why every time you do the configuration or changes it will ask one transport request.

Let's say zoom like this, we'll have a separate session for this.

I will explain each and everything in detail.

So.

The concrete.

Let me create a new transport here.

Like on the cross, on the

moldings.

It was CO2 and transport.

It was the company was defined.

What is the next step we need to do?

We need to define the company code now.

Company code is having a number of general ledger accounts or a profit ledger accounts, revenue accounts.

So many jobs are available in the system, so we don't have the proper knowledge to create each and

every general account.

So in order to create it, we simply copy the existing company code and change its name.

Because we are not consultants, right?

We don't have all the general user accounts and all other things.

So what we do is we simply copy the existing company code and we simply change the name of it.

Here you can see edit, copy, delete the company code, execute this.

And you can see the copy delete code, put the cursor here and click on choose.

Or else you can simply double click on it.

Both will be the same.

It will take you to the object code.

Here you can see the small copy button here.

Click on it.

It will be awesome.

From which company code to which country code you want to copy.

We have a standard company code.

We already had some standard company code will be given by the SAP server.

That is thousand in Germany.

I want to copy from 2000 to what is our company code, which would be having four digit.

Let me give us a Honda Motors hitch mode.

I'm giving is quite smart.

And you?

It was Boston.

We want to copy the company code data.

Yes, I want to copy all the general records from this browser.

Do you want to allocate a different local currency to the target company?

Because the current company code is having a euros.

Germany's in euros, right.

But our company in.

I am not.

So I want.

Study.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Our company code currency is in it, so I want to change it.

It is asking you, do you want to allocate the different local currency to target companies as.

So I want to change euros to I.A..

Okay.

Continue.

Click on continue.

It will be asking you to some confirmations.

Do you really want to transport number in?

Just click?

No.

Do not click as because as they are known consultants, we will create the number ranges.

Okay.

Click on.

It will be copying so many tables, different kinds of tables.

It is coping.

See here, you can see the percentage of it it is copying.

See if I can obtain the transported person I want to save in this same transport request.

Okay.

If want to create a new one.

Simply create a new one.

I want to save it in this simple.

See here you can see why.

019050.

It is nothing but a transport request number.

We call it a PR number.

It is copied.

So click on Cancel now.

Beyond the copy for the number range copy.

Let's select guess.

Copy.

So it was copied and copied to.

Now go back.

But that thousand company code was copied to Hazmat, but it descriptions its address.

All will be.

Available 1000 company code only.

Now we need to change those two days so you can see the edit company code data set here and click on

Choose or else you can simply double click on it.

It will be showing like this tough company called Survivor, which the users created like us.

Let me search for our company code.

Here you can see a small position button.

It is nothing but a sign button.

Click on this position button.

What is our company called?

Hedge my search for our company.

It is such our company called here.

Right.

Select this company code and click on details.

See, it's a description is showing us Bastogne, Germany.

But it is not how we coordinate the conditions.

Let me change the company name.

Okay.

I will be maintaining as Commander Motors Ltd and City maintenance.

Hyderabad and country is India.

See Karen's automatically taken because we already initiated it earlier.

Right?

So that decision is taken automatically and language is n enter.

Okay.

No, it's address.

Company code Address.

It is having small some address.

It doesn't have much details here.

You can see small.

Small.

This button.

Click on this button.

See, this is the 1000 company course address was available here.

Let me delete all the details.

Is there.

The.

Such step.

Whenever you want to search for this on motors, what is the search term?

You want to use it?

I want to use it as Honda Street address.

Do some speed.

I'm giving some random address.

Okay.

Yeah.

A friend told me about it.

I read India.

It is not a reason.

It's nothing but a shade.

Okay.

Yeah, I think in this reason God doesn't update it as Telangana on the page that simply select as on

the page.

It is just said that it is not updated with that.

If it is, the company is having any telephone number, it can maintain it.

Here.

It's a mail address.

What are the address?

You want to maintain it.

You can maintain.

It doesn't require.

The no, we maintained and we changed the description and address.

Now we are going to save it.

And now you save it.

The system must be transported.

So it will be saved in the same transfer.

See here, you can see that was saved.

But the next thing you want to create, like we created company company.

Now we are going to create controlling area.

Go back now.

Process financial accounting and go to controlling here can see the maintain controlling area click

on maintain controlling area.

Here you can see the entry slide.

Click on this maintain control area choose.

Here.

You can see so many controlling areas, right?

So let me do one thing, like maintain the new one.

See here we can create a new controlling area or else we can have a option that controlling area equal

to company.

That means we can maintain as controlling.

I mean, company code is nothing but controlling it, ie maintaining a tense company code where it is

asking like you want to maintain as controlling equal to company code.

Then what is your company code?

The team is asking what is your company code?

What is our company code?

A smart right is.

But I want to change the description because it is not Roundabout Ltd, it is a Honda Control.

Here you need to select a controlling area as small as it can be.

Don't worry about it.

This starts will be done by a consultant.

We don't need to be done in real time just for we want to use the plant and storage location.

You want to use them.

You need to assign it to the company and company.

That is why we are doing this task.

You can't sell.

It is sealed in that sail, so it is saved in the transport costs.

Close this window.

We define controlling it.

Now our task.

We need a defined plan.

So relocation.

See here.

Our know our role is to create the plan.

So in order to create that, we need to go to the logistics channel.

Here, we can have an option called defined valuation level, see the company's value in the materials

or something like what is a value of some warehouses like that.

It will be how we will have to take some valuations, right?

Yeah.

From their point of view, they need to check each and everything in valuation.

At the end of the day they will do some like accounting entries and some tasks will be available at

the end of the month.

OC How much profit is standard, how much revenues generated, how much loss it makes to a company like

that to have some valuations?

So for that purpose we need to act with that valuation level.

Initially, that is nothing but define valuation level.

Click on Execute.

Step always recommends to maintain valuation at planned level, not at company code level Y, because

for example, if you maintain that company code level OC valuation, if you maintain a company code

level, let's say a plant is located at Hyderabad and Plant B is located at Bangalore, plant is be

implanted, nothing but Hyderabad location.

The users are buying so many phone calls and the revenue and profit is very good at Hyderabad.

Okay then compared to Bangalore OC Bangalore the having buying very less cost and also the profits are

not so good in Bangalore.

Let's assume like this.

If you maintain that valuation level at company code area, then it does not have the ability to check

whether the Hyderabad having the better profits or Bangalore having the better profits.

Right.

So if you check the valuation here at company code level directly.

When you maintain a plant level, then it will check individual plant and it will have that.

Like the Bangladesh is having a less profits because nobody was buying so many cars.

So we need to increase the advertisements over there or else we need to initiate to people like that.

They will have some idea about it.

If we maintain at the plant level.

That is the reason why are separate commands to maintain.

It really is at plant level.

Okay.

You got it right.

Because every time I see it is in display mode.

Now go back.

And now we are going to create the plan.

Now, here you can see.

Define copy, delete.

Click on execute.

Here you can see that defined plan.

Right.

Select the country can choose.

Here you can see so many plans available.

So we need to create our new plants, right?

So in ASAP, do not create every time the new entries, just copy the existing plant and change the

names of the separate months.

You need to copy the existing plant and change the description.

What are the requirements you have?

Because everything was interlinked inside the exhibition.

That is the reason we do not create every time the new entries.

I'm selecting this plan.

Click on copy as I will change the example on the motors maintenance HPP LX one Honda Plant one OC.

What is the planned name like on the manufacturing plant?

It's okay.

And.

It would be asking that headdress.

It is a plan.

It is asking whether it is a plant, is a company or a single person.

It is asking.

It is a company.

And on the.

Manufacturing.

Okay, that's giving us.

Get inside.

Tell us.

So has a little bit.

Candy.

Okay.

See, the plant was copied, and I'm going to create another plant.

Let me select this plant and click on copy.

I will change it to.

But I do know, for example, it is something like.

That's something that.

But is the system.

Let's make some.

Bangladesh is not belong to Bangladesh.

It's not a problem.

It is a test purpose, right?

It is in India.

Okay, So we define plants here.

One is manufacturing plant and another one is on the assembly plant.

Once you.

I saved you to the transport request.

So data was saved.

So we define complete, complete code controlling area plants.

Now we are going to define storage location.

Go back.

Closest stores.

General go to materials management here can see storage location, maintain storage location.

Click on execute.

It is asking under which plan you want to create the storage location.

I want to create under one planet.

Here, let me create a new story.

Locations.

Here you can see this is available on new entries.

I maintain it as h11 on the storage location one.

Okay.

He's trying to do.

On the start of.

Okay.

It's one of his it.

All right, fine.

Under plant one.

Now we are going to define under plant.

It's been an new.

It's two one now.

H1N1 is 4.1.

It was a story location, but it sure understood that location.

Now we define so the location and the plants.

What is the next thing we need to define purchasing organization?

Here you can see maintain purchasing organization.

You can execute.

Let us do one thing.

We have a central purchasing system and the central purchasing system today.

Let us create one central purchasing system.

The countries.

I think it was on the.

But just.

Okay.

That meant an otherwise maintenance history.

The partisan involved.

See.

See, we defined SDB rule as done on the budget information.

So we defined all the individual organisation elements.

Now we need to assign them.

We define company.

We define company called planned purchasing organization, controlling editorial.

All these elements we define.

Now we are going to connect all of them.

Right.

So now we configure down the definition, close this definition of go to assignment, go to financial

accounting again.

Here you can see assign company, go to company.

We've got execute.

What is our report?

What?

And.

See, there's happy blank.

On this button so that we can search for our company.

What is our company?

On the.

Selected.

So I just, you know, save it.

So the company was assigned.

Sorry, the company code is assigned to company.

Of course, this financial accounting go to controlling the same company.

Go to controlling area.

You can't execute.

What is our controlling area?

H Mart.

Selected.

And here you can see small forwarded assignment of company code select Controlling area.

Click on this assignment of complete code yet no entries available.

Click on new entries.

Here.

We need to maintain our company.

For months, it seemed that I was safe.

So it was complicated.

Now go to logic.

General lesson plan to company execute.

Here.

We need to assign the plans to company or click on new entries.

Why does our company call it more?

And what is our brand?

And it's smart where they find two plants right in it.

End to end.

This here.

And see on action.

Plan on Don't Save.

So we assign plans to company.

Go see?

Yes.

We assigned company to company code and controlling area to company code and plans to company code.

Now what?

We are going to do this to the location, the plan.

But we are already assigned.

We are ready.

Sorry, Joseph, you are applicable?

Yes.

We are going to find the storage location under the plan so we do not need to assign.

Again, we are during the creation of the location is the system.

Ask under which plan we want to create the store of location.

Right.

So already the assignment was completed.

We don't need to assign the storage location.

I know we are going to do the partisan coordination assignment.

Let us go with a central purchasing system for central purchasing.

What is what we need to do?

We need to assign the same partisan commission to Camp Nicole, same partisan coordination to the plans.

This is the central purchasing system.

If it is decentral means each plant will be having individual purchasing organizations.

Right?

Let us go with the central purchasing system.

Tomatoes management here can see purchasing automation to accompany core purchasing automation to plan.

And as we already discussed about it, reference purchasing automation and as we discussed about the

standard purchasing mortgage, remember?

Right.

Yes, that is asset purchase information to company.

First, we can execute.

What is our purchasing organization?

Steve Buell.

I already told you about it.

Single purchasing organization will be assigned to this single company.

Right.

So it is having only single entry.

You don't have to enter multiple company codes.

What is our company code?

A smart.

So best end outcome we could be involved.

And again, that's important information to plants.

But here.

We can maintain forests in multiple purchasing organizations.

I'm in the study.

We can assign multiple plans to the single purchasing automation.

Right.

The countries that maintain its people.

HBO.

Keep people.

Let's be.

It is our plan.

Okay.

Nope.

Same standard purchasing automation to plan.

We can take one of the organization as the standard.

I already told you about that.

You.

Right?

What is our plan?

It's PL1.

We can make it as we are having only a single purchasing organization using so that purchasing automation

can be used as a standard.

If we are using an individual.

Also, we can maintain that OC.

To assign standard budget information?

Depends.

No.

Asset purchase mortgage to refinance purchase.

But it is a central system.

We are having a single purchasing operation.

We don't require to use a reference here because if you are using a multiple purchase equations, then

we can use as a reference.

Right.

But we are using a central system.

So not quite as going to friends.

If you want the business requires, then you can use it.

So this is how we do the configuration for and the power structure.

And also we are left with the one thing like we will define one purchasing group.

Right.

Purchasing group is nothing but a group of people or a single person who is responsible to procure the

materials from the external sources.

Right.

So we will define during the three months data or else if we want to go and create the purchasing group

as well, we can do that.

Go to metals management, the purchasing.

Here you can see create purchasing groups.

Here we can create the purchasing group so we can execute.

Here you can see the partisan groups.

Let me mention a new entry here.

It's PG.

Oak Island bipartisan group.

But if it is having a telephone number or fax number, you can maintain order, an email address you

can maintain, and all of the things you can't sell.

It will not be assigned to any other organization or any other plant or something.

It will be created at a client level.

This is how we define the interface structure completely.

Okay.

If you want to see that structure by visualization, you can see this here.

You can see the structure.

So you can see like this structure.

I will show you that we defined the company code.

Right.

Go to that company code.

Its mission here can see the complete quote we define.

We can execute copy.

We have done some task copy here.

You can see the small structure button on this structure and go to navigation.

Continue.

Here.

You can see so many companies are available here.

Let us search for our company.

Click Control F in your keyboard.

Simply control F or as you can see, this here fine button.

Click on this fine button.

Here, let me a Honda.

What else gives each market what will be seen to be such a company code?

Click on it.

Here you can see that with the cursor.

Here you can see small red color rectangle box is coming.

It means selected.

The details choose.

This is a structure.

What is what we define?

This is a company.

Company name is what?

Honda.

Honda is assigned to company code.

If you click on this press button, it will show the company.

See?

Each one is assigned to each mode and thus controlling area.

Each mode controlling area is assigned to company code.

If you click on it, you can see the complete assembly and also.

And as we define the plans OC plant is assigned to.

Well plant is assigned to.

That is a simple question and also complicated.

It is linked to company code and it is linked to purchase and valuation, Right.

Now, if you open this one, it will show you two entries.

One is company code and another one is purchasing.

See?

And as it is are same story locations as well.

Right.

So so relocations company code purchasing ordinance.

You can see right.

So this is a structure we define.

And but this information also assigned to company bought and plans.

This is how we've done the configuration for enterprise structure.

Any questions?
