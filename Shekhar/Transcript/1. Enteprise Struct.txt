So today we are going to learn about the entropy structure of SAP.

Okay, Joseph, now can you hear me right.

Just confirming.

We are going to discuss support and structure in Amman before going to explain about and structure.

Just look at the general business structure of the company or what we have done from outside.

Let me give you a small subset of groups in the in here.

Tata Group is a corporate group.

We already known about it in that we are having two companies.

Let's assume it is having so many entities like Tata motors, Tata Steel, Apollo Tata Consultancy Service.

These kind of these are having on the Tata group.

Let's assume we just have only two companies right now and the Tata group in that we are having two

companies which are known as Tata motors and Tata Steel.

We already know that Tata motors is the biggest automobile manufacturing company in India and coming

to Tata Strauss, it is an Indian multinational steelmaking company in Tata motors.

What we have we are having one manufacturing plant, let's assume like this to do manufacturing activities

and another plant like assembly factory or something to do assembly activities as well as in Tata Steel's

okay let's say like this, but also in real time they will be having so many factories, not only manufacturing,

there will be some sales activities going on.

So it will be having some kind of warehouses, different kind of activities can be done.

Maybe the polishing activities.

So many factors will be there.

Let's say it is having only to for our example, it is having two plants.

One is manufacturing a factory and another assembly factory.

And under this manufacturing and assembly factories, we are having these two locations to show the

manufacturing product or assembly.

Okay, let's assume this is the general business structure we had.

No.

And the screen that you see gives you what are the general terms.

This is how it is carried out inside their cities, in outside what we call it is corporate groups,

representative group.

We call it as a client or company in a city.

This is the terminology we use inside the city.

And subsidiaries like Company Codes, like we call it the Tata motors, Tata motors, Tata Steel or

Tata Power.

These kinds of entities will be available.

Those will be called it.

As a company goes on factory.

A factory can be called.

It is a plant inside a city, whether it is a manufacturing factory or it is a assembly.

Fact, whatever the factory we call it is a plant in SAP.

And generally we call some storerooms, like after finishing of material, we stored it somewhere else,

whether it is a warehouse or storage location or storage room.

We call inside that species as a storage location.

Okay.

This is the terms we use inside the CIP system.

OC.

And then.

Here.

How do you maintain?

Furthermore, I have given some structure in assembly in this right.

Here is how the organization structure is maintained.

The first hierarchy level is the client.

Client is nothing but a company, which is nothing but a Tata group.

It will be followed by complete codes.

And followed by plans and followed by store locations.

This is how the structure will be in the structure.

And also we have another apprentice controlling area.

And so one purchasing information we can see.

So in this structure, what are the entities we define coming to our own prospect?

What we define is we will define purchasing organization, planned store location.

These are the entities we will create in our system.

But why?

We are sure why I am showing to you like client company controlling it.

We are not defining those systems because without those entities we can't create the planned assignment

to the company code.

Right.

That is the reason why we need to define this in real time.

What happens is these entities will be defined by the finance department, will take care of it.

The client, which is nothing but a company and company code and controlling area, will be defined

by people.

Our job is to create plans.

We will configure the plans, store the location and purchase information.

And also we have another small purchasing group available.

It is not having any mind to it.

I will explain that in the coming slide.

So this is the structure of Eminem in this part called Magician Plan and Storage Location will be defined

by Eminem consultant.

Okay.

And company.

Company code.

I mean, company means let's assume a client is a company.

Client company called Controlling data will be defined by the.

Now.

Okay.

See, in this structure, let me explain each entity individually.

See, the first is called client.

Client is nothing, but we are known to top and company code in this company code.

What happens is a company code is an independent organization which is registered under the companies

like it will be having some general accounts.

What are the earnings?

What are the profits?

Different kinds of gender religious will be available.

Right?

We need to store in that concept that will be taken care of by people.

That is nothing but the company code and controlling area.

It will controls the expenditure and earnings of a company called.

Just simply just understand it.

It is not defined by us.

No need to worry about it.

I'm coming to purchasing organization.

Okay.

This purchasing organization, it will take care of all the procurement needs of the company.

Because, for example, plant requires some material X to manufacture DX, or let's assume it is, it

requires some 100 pistons to manufacture the 100 balls.

So.

It needs to tell to some organization to procure those materials.

Right.

So this is the purchasing organization will take care of those all the procurement needs of a company.

Which is nothing but a purchasing organization.

See the name itself thing.

But Chase organization means it will be take care of all the procurement needs of IT company or whether

it is a plant and plant is nothing but where in this plant it is having like some manufacturing activities.

It will be having some some activities or testing activities maybe can be a sales act.

It used to be carried out in the plant and coming to storage location.

It is also a small element development unit.

It will take care of the all inventory activities.

After manufacturing or anything, if you procure anything from outside or if you manufacture by your

own or you need to store it somewhere else, which is not in today's location.

Okay.

You understand that each and every unit know coming to purchasing organization, it will be having two

kind of purchasing.

One is central purchasing.

Second one is the central purchasing.

First, let us discuss with central purchasing.

After that, I will explain you about the central purchases.

See, this is the structure of central purchasing system.

See here, just see here.

The purchasing order is assigned to company code and the same purchasing is assigned to plan.

If the purchasing organization is assigned to plan means purchasing coordination, one will be taking

care of all the procurement needs of the plan.

And this is purchasing automation.

The same purchasing automation will be assigned to the Plan B that the same purchasing automation will

be.

Acre all the procurement needs of Plan B, which is nothing.

But if the purchasing organization is responsible to procure all the needs of a company, if it is assigned

to all the partners, all plans will be responsible for the respect to purchasing organization.

Okay.

This is nothing but this central purchasing system.

The same parties and coordination will be assigned to company code, and the same purchasing coordination

will be assigned to the plans, which is nothing but central purchasing.

The name itself saying central purchasing means one purchasing coordination will be taking care of all

the plans inside the company code, inside the Tata motors.

That is nothing but central purchasing system.

Coming to the central purchasing system.

In this central purchasing system, what happens is the partisan coordination.

I mean, each plant is having individual purchasing organization will be assigned to it to to responsible,

to procure those materials for respect to plan C here, the purchasing orders one is assigned to planned

purchasing.

Organization two is assigned to plan B.

That means each plant is having individual purchasing organizations, which is nothing but a D central

purchasing.

And that's one more thing.

Very important Dispatching coordination will not be assigned to any company.

OC In central purchasing what happens?

The same purchasing organization will be assigned to the company code, but in D central purchasing

that's purchasing coordination will not be assigned to the company code.

That is 1.2, you must understand.

See.

Why does.

I mean, why did the SAP provide these kind of systems?

Let's say zoom see that says it's a startup company.

It was located only at Hyderabad and Bangladesh, only two places it will be available.

It does not require a large purchasing organization.

It will be having a small partition location, for example.

It needs to know around ten lakhs or something that says it is small company, it is small small company.

It is having some of the of 1000.

So for one crore of turnover, it does not require individual participations to procure the materials.

It will be having a small purchase involved.

It is enough for them.

For example, if you take a multinational companies one partition recognition will not have the ability

to procure to responsible to take care of all the procurement needs of all the companies, because the

plans are situated in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai and also other countries.

See, Tata motors is located in so many countries, so different countries will be located at.

These companies are located in different countries.

So single operation will not be have the ability to take care of all the procurement needs.

So that is the reason why they will go with this system.

And also another example, I will give you that.

For example, one plant is located in Hyderabad and one plant is located in Bangalore and one plant

is located.

Let's assume the headquarters is at Bangalore.

The partisan is having a single purchase information they are using like this is the central purchasing.

They were using the central purchasing system.

So after onwards, what happens is that every time they will procure from Bangalore and they will send

it to the Chennai location and the Hyderabad location.

So instead of doing that, the Plan B proposal that we all have the same quality of materials is available

at Chennai location and also the vendor area has the better market.

He was giving the better market prices.

So why we are going to buy in Bangalore?

Can you have another individual purchase managed to procure at this place?

It will decrease our transportation cost as well.

That is how the Plan B proposes to the main branch so that OC go ahead and buy the quality is good in

Chennai location.

Why we are wasting our money to transport from Bangalore to Chennai.

You can buy there like that.

They will maintain their individual purchasing coordination itself.

Understand yourself why we are using this individual purchasing automation to assign to specific plant.

You understand, right?

See, this is happening right?

Why?

We are buying from Bangalore and transported to the Chennai.

We already have some vendors here.

Why can't we buy it here?

Right.

So that is the reason why we can use individual purchasing automations at plant level.

And also maybe the chances is like this, if it is a startup company or small company, why can't we

use use purchasing organization system to procure the materials?

We can use a single purchasing organization system, right?

Like why we are using multiple purchasing systems based on the company.

Also, the see, you can't understand, like the purchasing organization will be one huge building or

it can be a one floor or it can be one cubicle in an office, but it just zooms purchasing coordination.

It will take care of the procurement needs of the company.

That's it.

Whether it is a fuse building, the purchasing will be huge building or is it will be a single floor.

It will be having some 30 numbers, but it is a ten floors building, maybe a 50 people and single purchasing

organization.

It will be call.

It is a purchasing automation.

If it is a 40 members also call it is a purchasing organization.

If it is a four members also it will be call.

It is a purchase information based on the company.

The members will be increased based on the ability of their procuring, based on the tunnel.

Okay.

And also we have, you know, the difference between Central and central.

This is the overall picture.

Like, this is called central purchasing.

The same purchasing organization will be assigned to company Core.

The same organization will be assigned to plans, which is nothing but central purchasing.

This is called Decentral.

It will not be assigned to any company codes and it will be directly assigned to plans.

And also, the one thing I want to tell you is the same partisan organization can be seen to both because

under the plans, see, this is a same Plan B and a company called one.

This can be assigned to plan C, and the complete quote is nothing but a cross company code purchasing

organization, we call it as a cross country code purchasing organization.

Now, we already how we already discussed central and the center.

Now we are going to discuss about reference purchasing operation.

What is this reference purchasing organization?

Here you can see right.

A company called one Company CO two is in a company called one.

Partisan coordination one is responsible to take care of, but to plan one and plan to.

It is having partisan organization to let's do both plans under company.

Let's forget about company quota.

Let's focus on company code one first.

See that says Zoom plant one requires piston OC.

Plan to request some in some shops or something.

They will be procuring materials from their individual purchasing organization, will be take care of

purchasing coordination.

One will go and check the vendor and they will buy the pistons and purchasing alteration to.

They will go and check the shop who are who is the supplier.

They will go and negotiate with the vendor and they will bought it.

This is how happening in the procurement side.

So then, but Plant one requires the piston and plan to request the piston.

Then if to go and buy individually from the different vendors the prices are costing.

As for example plant one is costing ₹100, plant is costing 100 this single piston.

They are going buy with the different vendors, but if they go and buy in a single vendor, they will

go and buy from a single vendor.

Single supplier.

Why?

They are individually Go on.

Buy the products from the supplier.

They can.

They're buying some huge quantities.

Right.

So if you buy a huge quantity from the vendor, he will be giving better discount.

Right.

So buy it.

Ten bucks.

You can't.

They will be.

They don't provide much of us.

Like in school times when you buy a book from us.

But books from the shop, they will be giving some one pennies.

A free or the stickers is a free site.

It simply say if you buy anything in bulk quantity, it will be that it will be getting a better discount.

So that is the reason why, if the both plastic were the same material, then if they want to maintain

some contact with the same vendor, why?

Why they are going individually and making a contact with the different suppliers by the same suppliers.

So what happens is, is it is here reference purchasing automation is used to maintain the contract

with with the vendor so that it will have a better discount.

So this reference purchasing, So can you be a better discount like that?

You will ask with the vendor and he will negotiate and he will bind the price like nothing but the contracts

we have.

So that is the benefit of reference purchasing here.

Okay.

See what the difference is.

This is central purchasing.

This is the central.

Central press.

Central is nothing but a reference purchase of Central.

Thus, de Central is nothing but a reference purchasing organization.

Okay.

Let me do one thing.

Let me right here so that you can understand it better.

Central purchase.

Symptoms such as exhaustion.

See what in central purchasing system, what happens.

Example by phone.

Purchasing automation is essential.

That same.

And also.

First.

The first assignment.

Here we do.

When the same company and the same parties with the same client one.

And this same purchasing automation one will be assigned to.

When.

And you see anybody's nomination for best general plan, right?

So this is how the assignment will be.

And coming to the central purchasing system.

Coming to.

The central purchasing system.

I think one will be assigned to one, but two will be assigned to plan to purchase and three will be

assigned to plan three.

But here.

Any purchasing orders will not be sent to any company.

Okay.

That is nothing but it.

The central purchasing system.

And here what happens in that central purchasing system.

One chasing organization.

Is the responsible.

We plan to.

Procure.

Procurement.

Of all the mines.

The company.

Purchasing.

Purchasing is responsible to responsible procurement of all the plants in the company, which is nothing

but a central purchasing system.

And also another point is.

Here.

I will write it on

one part.

Chasing.

To be assigned.

The only one company.

C c is nothing but company.

But I could only shortcut one purchasing or to be assigned to only one company.

CO one purchasing automation cannot be assigned to multiple conflicts.

The system is won't allow you to the same purchasing organization will not be assigned to multiple companies.

Only a single company will

not.

The company code can be.

Assigned to multiple.

But it is not okay.

You understand your single purchasing organization.

2% to one company.

But a single company can be assigned to the multiple purchasing organizations.

You understand it, right?

So this is the central purchasing system.

And also, one more thing I would like to know.

These are the plants, right?

So one plant

and how many design goals?

And Seb has same one chasing God.

And how might

you understand?

One plant can help multiple purchasing organizations and the same purchasing automation can have multiple

plants.

It's not a problem.

This is the point you need to understand during the assignment and during the configuration.

You can understand it better because we are visualizing the system so you can understand it better.

Just it is a theoretical.

You will be having some little bit confusion.

I'm coming to decentralization system.

Each plant will be having its competition coordination to handle their procurements internally.

Right.

Coming to reference Purchasing organization in reference Choosing organization.

He sent her.

The transportation valuation is nothing but.

Central this.

Recently.

Central Plus Central is nothing about the French partisan garbage here.

What is the central one purchasing organization responsible for all the plans of the company?

The central plan will be having its own purchasing organization to handle the procurement activities.

Here.

What we see is here like decentralize somehow 80% and is somehow 20%.

See here, for example.

Also the parties in co-ordination one will be sent to plant one using option two is assigned to plant

two and purchasing automation.

Three is assigned to plant three.

This is nothing but a decentralized system.

And one more thing is purchasing organization.

For that says Zoom.

We can take OC here.

We can take reference purchasing automation as one of the three purchasing organizations, or else you

can create another purchasing automation and it will be taken as a reference position about what can

be possible.

Just if you understand it, you can take purchasing automation one as a reference or else, but two

as a reference for those purchasing operation.

Three as a reference, for example, in the apartment.

You are having some issue, some some water problem or something.

It is having some ten flags.

So in ten flags, we are not how to go to ten members to the management and tell this is the issue.

We can take one of the member as a team leader in Ten Flags.

One of the member, have it team leader and he will go and tell the management that this is the water

problem we are having in flats.

Can you do anything to solve the issue like that?

He can talk to the management or else the management itself plays one leader that to to take care of

the water, the needs of the ten flats and then he is the leader and he will be taken of the.

You are having an issue.

Just let me know.

I will talk to the management like that.

They can put in one representative, you understand?

Joseph Yeah, we can take one of the parties automation as a reference or else you can go with the new

information.

That party's nomination for.

As a reference, you can take anything.

You can create new patches.

Our you can take it as a reference purchasing, let's say here I'm taking one of the purchasing automation

as a reference one as a reference

to ten flats or ten flats or a water problem or maintenance problem.

So really management to negotiate your stuff.

So this is a problem we're having in flats to ten flats or you're not maintaining properly.

Could you please try to solve the issue like that?

You can ask others under the present to maintain.

Yes, generally like a pristine quality, persistent like that.

We're having some apartments go to some extent.

You can go out and talk with the person.

Then the person will talk to the management, like the owner of the building, apartment building.

So this is how happens in safe systems.

So I will take us there.

It says the reference purchasing organisation.

So now what we need to do is we need to assign this purchasing organisation one.

I mean.

See here.

From here it is having I told you that it is having some center and center.

See here each plan will be having individual purchasing organizations, but plan on plan to plan to

acquire the same areas they want to buy from the same vendor.

So we need to create one reference purchasing organization.

So I taken purchasing one as the reference.

And this purchasing organization needs to assign to the purchasing cognition.

One part is amalgamation to purchase information.

This is a reference.

Okay.

Do not confuse.

Okay.

We need to.

So this reference purchasing.

What is this AutoNation will do?

This will negotiate with vendor.

And he will maintain the contract.

He will bind the contract.

So when we assign this reference purchasing automation, when we create a contract with respect to this

purchasing automation, any automation assigned to this reference can have the option to procure from

the same end.

Okay.

You understand, right?

Yeah.

So then I will remove this as.

And so this purchasing organization three does not have the option to procure from the contract because

it not assigned to the reference purchasing organization, because it does not want any materials from

the vendor.

The same material OC.

That is the purpose of this assignment.

Reference to our purchasing information assignment.

Okay.

You got it right.

What is the difference between Central?

What is the difference between central purchasing system?

And what is the reference purchasing obligation?

See, most of the companies were using this central system because it have a better advantage.

They will be buying from local vendors without any transportation charges because from Bangalore and

buying and sent it to the channel.

The transportation cost is more hundreds coming to nowadays.

The petrol cost is very high.

Why they are going by.

Right.

So.

So they will consider all these functionalities, some parameters from outside like quality and.

They will choose the vendor.

Okay.

Yeah.

And the centralized system also is having its own advantages and decentralized systems, which is having

its own advantage.

It is also each plant is procuring themselves only each plant is working by their own plant itself only

because the plants are not.

Yes.

Yes.

Right.

Because it is having its own advantages.

Right.

Because why?

We are going buy from some other place, some way or something and take it to the bank or hydro.

But why we are doing right.

If you just getting a better quality and better price, then only we can make it because its transportation

costs is very high.

Right.

So that is the reason this individual plant is procuring.

They are maintaining their own purchasing department.

That is that is of decentralization.

You understand here why we are using reference purchasing information.

Reference is used where our individual check by so group of people how a leader can live or negotiate

use.

So they are leader under law under Walmart responsible.

Right.

Right.

See, my apartment shows contracts, the building, the buildings, the building, and maybe each department

and each will be having individual press teams.

So question one will negotiate just that will be going towards the building.

One, if the President to negotiate just a building.

Two Right.

So that is how we'll be.

It will be okay.

And we are and also we are having another purchasing organization that is not having any impact on anything

or just what is standard, but is not standard purchasing.

Organization.

Standard purchasing organization.

Look at what it means.

It is used to create automatic purchase order creation.

We have some concepts, okay?

We have some automatic people creations.

Yuki, you are the end user, right?

You are creating manually the purchase order.

If your system wants to create the view automatically from PR, we use the standard purchasing automation.

And also we have some other concepts like special procurements, consignment by plane, and also stock

transfers.

These types of concept, we use this standard purchasing automation and stock transfer right during

the period of time we use the standard purchasing mortgage.

Why?

Because it simply say we're having a four partisan organizations.

One of them one of them make it as a primary.

OC OC One of the pathogens we use regularly that touches on regulation will procure some kind of special

procurements, stock transfers, this kind of processor that we use some standard purchase information,

which is nothing but a standard.

I will tell you, during the creation of those special procurements and automatic proclamations, I

will tell you about this purchasing operation that says we are having some standard purchase information.

It will be used in automatic creation of pools and some special procurements.

Okay, let's assume like this.

Okay.

I will explain about this in detail.

While we are running some transactions, a business transactions.

So this is how the organizational structure will be here.

We will create a lot of the hour whenever everyone asks, like whenever what is the structure?

When they ask, you need to tell.

Like we will create plan, which is information and storage location.

Do not tell client I'm in company company code, controlling data.

All other things do not care like that.

Whenever they ask what is the structure you need to tell?

That is information plans, total location that and let let me tell you whenever and ask for a purchasing,

we create a purchase organization and the purchase organization create a plan plan on the plan store

locations.

Yes.

Not purchasing and purchasing coordination under plan.

You will tell like this, we will define plan, storage location, and also we will define parties in

the organization.

That's it.

It is not commander purchasing organization, but it's not coordination will be assigned to it, which

is responsible to procurement needs.

But store allocations come under the plan plan.

And also under this purchasing organization.

We will be having some parties groups look at certain groups are defined at client level.

And can create purchasing documents for any purchasing information.

The group of people who are responsible to take care of, take care of all the procurement activities

of the materials and as purchasing groups are not assigned to any purchasing agency under the purchasing

organization.

There will be split split into some groups.

For example, high value items will be taken off the one group.

Low value items will be taken off by one group.

Maybe they will be split based on their business.

Maybe they will be segregate like some metal items will be take care of this group and some plastic

items will be taken of this by this group.

They would be split some groups under the organization.

This purchasing cognition may be a single person or a group of people.

It can be a single person.

It can be a group of people.

He is nothing but a buyer.

Purchasing group is nothing but a buyer.

He will go and buy the materials.

That's it.

Under the parties information, you understand what is purchasing group, but nothing but a single person.

Or is a group of people who will take care of the will by buy the from the external sources under the

purchase information, but it will not be assigned to any purchasing organization.

It will be created at client level.

Client level means when never understand client level means it will be eligible for any area under any

plan, any company code.

The person is going to create go and buy the materials.

That's it.

It is nothing but the client level.

Then come on.

The plant level means it is only responsible to particular plant.

That is not plant level.

Client means already tell you that client means it higher.

Tata Group.

If you create a data group level that's under that data group, we are having so many company calls

Tata motors, Tata Steel, whatever the company.

So client clients, you understand the client on this top corporate level.

Okay.

Any questions, Joseph?

You understand or let me explain again.

Let me let me just.

Let me give you a small overview.

Let me give a small overview so that after that, if you're having any questions, just let me see here.

This is the structure of ACP PR client company.

Quote, controlling area will be defined by people and purchasing organization.

Plans toward a location will be defined by armed people, but using automation is nothing.

But this is automation where it would be responsible to take care of all the procurement needs of the

company codes followed by the plans followed by store relocations.

And according to purchase, the organization will have some two types of purchasing systems.

One is central purchasing and another one is the central purchase.

What is the central purchasing?

Central purchasing means a single purchasing organization will be assigned to this company code followed

by the plans.

So similar purchasing orders will be take care of procurement needs of all the plans under the company

code, which is nothing but the central purchasing system and coming to the central purchasing systems

purchasing.

Each plan will be having an individual purchasing system which is not plan specific purchasing organization.

We call it assembly.

So it will be it will not be assigned to any company code.

It will be assigned to yes, it is nothing but a plan specific, you can call it as a specific does

nothing about it the central purchasing system.

So it is having some advantages.

I already told you about it.

Yeah.

And it is lot auto sector.

This is nothing but a central purchasing.

It is nothing but these central.

Right.

So if you assign this to multiple company, this is nothing but a cross company code purchasing organization.

And one more thing, the reference purchasing organization.

What do you mean by this reference purchasing organization?

It will be negotiated with the actual vendors and they will create the contracts.

And who are the responsible?

Purchasing information is assigned to this reference purchasing organization.

So that purchasing organization has the authorization to create the release orders.

And then after purchasing ownership, we are having a small entity that is nothing, but it is not complete

entity.

It is a group of people or person, nothing but a buyer.

We will buy the materials from the.

External vendors.

Many questions.

No, no, no, no.
