Okay, Let me create another table.

There is the window.

But single ignition group company could.

And we need to get the material on this thousand quantity.

Land we need to maintain Blanton So the location can.

Go to messages to show it out.

Why it is triggered because we maintained the condition record.

Combination of document types, DMV and purchasing automation, DLP and VENDOR has.

When these combinations came up, then the output will be triggered and you see what are the combinations

is can we maintain the vendor assessor and purchasing automation and DLP?

That is where the message was triggered.

And if you see the communication here, local and print immediately came from condition record, go

to communication.

You can see local intermediate immediately.

When you maintain this for.

Which is nothing but send immediately dispatched to.

So when you go to.

For the data can see for as and immediately this is because of we maintain in conditioning areas and

immediately when you click on sale.

It will be processed successfully to green.

Go to messages.

Now, see, that means we can take a print out of this printing, for example.

Let me change.

Climate change to the.

Decommissioning.

Second option.

Didn't.

Sorry, I'm in 0404 read.

Creation and growth while the change in ownership.

Check.

Quoting suggest

that data is taken as strictly not thought because we maintain in condition recorders.

Three.

If you save it, it will not be processed successfully.

Let us see what would ensue.

Gordon I the hostilities in warning.

So now I mean nine F is the decode.

Because the document number, which is the number we need to give here, a new crossing status.

Not processed.

My name is my sister and application is here to execute.

The details of it.

From here.

Also, we can.

Because their output.

EILPERIN Totally.

If you want to take a printout from here, also, you can take this printout.

Okay.

NASA's already processed masses.

First process.

Let me check.

But then I see this.

See, it was processed not because we select it and click on output message.

Then it is processed.

This is how adoption trees works and another two options are available based on the backgrounds of creation.

It will be automatically processed in the Bible.

Let us do some negative testing here.

We define four zero and create four below zero.

The list of windows.

It.

The north needs to be triggered, Right?

Go to messages.

See now triggered because we maintain a connection only for ourselves and not for the LOL vendor.

That way, the output type is not triggered here, so we can't take the print out.

This is how the output deterioration is created in the backbone configuration.
