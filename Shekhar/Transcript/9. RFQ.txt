We are going to discuss a request for cooperation and cooperation and compassion as well.

For at least sessions we completed the purchase requisitions, right?

Yes.

So what do you mean by this purchase requisition?

The respective departments will raising the cost to the purchasing department either whether they want

materials or services, they will request to the purchasing department to procure the materials.

And also they will maintain in purchasing equation that how much quantity they required and when will

be the required like delivery date.

Right.

So in that also we during the creation itself, we need to assign the purchasing group who is the person

who is responsible to procure the material that is nothing but purchase requisition.

After that, after they will raise their question to the purchasing department, then the purchasing

department.

If the company doesn't have any source to procure source determination, there is no vendor to procure

the material.

Then they will go for request for quotation.

I mean, they will send their request for quotation to the multiple vendors and then the vendor will

quote their prices like there will be some four or five vendors are available to the near location of

the plan.

Then they will raise their request for quotation to those vendors and then they will the company will

receive the quotations from the vendor and they will compare the prices and also not the prices will

be taken as a primary factor.

They also consider the quality of the product and also if the company orders a bulk quantity, the vendor

had the capability to procure vendor had the capability to send the materials to the plant or not,

they will check those parameters.

They will check the brand value of the actual vendors, and then they will select the vendor along with

the price parameter.

After the selection process will go on, the company will rise.

The order to the vendors.

This is the process coming to request for quotation.

It is nothing but this is a simple invitation to various vendors with they request to offer their quotations

for the companies requirement.

That is nothing but the request for quotation here as like the participation here.

Also, we need to define one document and we need to assign one number to.

So here, like the participation in one document as well as the number range, and we need to assign

that to this request for quotation.

But request for quotation, we have a standard document called and then is the standard RFQ document.

So let me show you that as belonging to ACP.

For bass, piano and Saint-Saens.

And then go to metals management.

But choosing.

And then go to.

And then how called the for quotation by quotation.

You can see right top down this you can how define document types and a number ranges.

Let's go to different document types.

Let's see all of the document types available.

So you can see here is the standard document type, right?

So here is the standard document.

In real time.

We use the same document.

If you need any customizations, you can go with the Z and all depends on the person.

Let us use the directly the standard models.

You already know about it.

How to copy this document type and you want to make any changes.

You can do that right?

That's the one thing.

They use this to.

If I'm not able to see the screen.

Oh, let me shoot.

Yeah.

Now you can see that.

Hello, Joseph.

I able to see the screen.

Joseph, can you hear me?

Yeah, Yeah.

Now able to see the screen?

Yeah.

Okay.

I deleted that entry.

Okay, let me copy this and maintain it.

Okay.

We all know about it.

How to customize this document.

Select this document standard and click on Copy is.

And let me put as Z.

And let me put this of to document and.

So all entries were copied here.

And number range.

If you want to create a new number, then you can create and send it here or else you can use the existing

number.

See here six is the number.

Enjoy the sender's internal and 61 section.

Let me say this and go back and see.

Let us see what the number is here.

You can execute this 60 number and just right.

See 66 cities.

Let us keep it like this.

Let us use the existing number here.

60.

Even want to create a new number which you can go ahead and create new number in your assignment.

This is my contribution here.

It was completed.

I know.

If you want to create a RFQ to the external sources, we need to use a transaction code.

Call me 41 and me 41.

Is that the code where we can create the RFP here?

We can create manually orders.

We have an option called with reference to purchase request now so you can create.

Let me show you that.

Let me take any of the creations.

If I and it's is the report where you can see the list of requests.

Right.

That does give us a plant.

What is our plan?

One.

Zelda Mandrake Manufacturing Plant Exhibit.

It will display all the years which we created.

See, these are the dystopias we created.

So let me take one pill here.

So this is a part of the equation how many items it is had.

Christian is a material.

So it is having two materials here that is created with reference to this, but because production department

requires these two materials.

So we will negotiate with the external vendors.

Right.

So let me create it.

First of all, let me maintain the RFQ document, which is our document.

Let me check out the list of document types available.

We created a Z A on our.

Okay, let me select this and language to English and the RFQ date.

Today's date because we are creating quotation deadline in quotation.

That means before the deadline itself, the vendor needs to send their quotations.

Because today only right we are selecting the vendor.

So let me put this to test.

It will be generated automatically because we are using an original number range and here we need to

put the purchasing organization.

What is our purchasing organization?

This CPU and purchasing GOG, HPG, Manufacturing group and plant.

What is our plan is be alone

and so the location is is one.

I think we don't care if you create a reference with the creation.

Is it a pathetic creation we already copied?

Let me continue.

Okay.

The quiet empress, collector number.

It is nothing but some kind of.

What is the invitations you are giving for reason?

You need to put one collector number.

Here, let me put the.

On one.

And this is the question that it is.

The quotation deadline is the same date itself.

And now click on enter.

See if you ask it is taken.

But is recreation having two line items?

See how much quantity in participation you just copied.

Okay, let me select both the line items and you can see here, add up the details.

You can click on add up tickets.

Okay.

These are.

These are quantities.

Order.

It is a ordered unit, and it's taken out of context.

Why?

Because I think we maintain some info record for this material.

Let me check why it is taking 20 boxes.

But this method it that much.

See here.

We put it as a ordinary test box.

But in parties requisition, if you go to purchase requisition, we maintain them.

Each is right.

That is the reason why it is pushing some matters.

See, it will contain.

Yes.

And also it is having some delivery date.

Today is the delivery date.

So let me change this delivery date.

Okay.

I understand why it is picking 20 quantity here.

The pier itself will maintain 200 inches.

But in Metro Marshall, we maintain this box.

That is the reason we're taking all directive.

But this unit of measurement is also like each.

And if we share the same metal metal

bit, but it is taking order unit here it is taking the order unit because we are requesting the vendors

right.

For vendors.

Why we are not ordering in inches, we are ordering in boxes.

That is the reason why we put here box.

Right.

It is nothing but order unit.

Right.

And let me change here the delivery date.

I want this song.

I'll be for it.

Let me take those 20 and.

And it explodes as well.

So it's taken to 55.

But because if you go and see in Metro data, it doesn't have any other unit.

Let me show you that has

a quote on that before 20.

Let me show you that.

See here.

There is no ordinary citizen.

It doesn't take in the ordinary as a consideration.

Is taken only each.

Now, see, both items was taken from the purchase requisition.

It is 20 boxes is required for piston on each box.

We want to see for each box how many pictures you maintained.

What additional data and go to unit of measures.

Here you can see one box equal to ten inches.

If we maintain one box equal to ten inches.

And we need to send this request for quotation to the vendors.

Right.

Care to consider vendor addresses Small button available.

Right click on this vendor address.

Here we need to select for which vendor we want to send this RFQ.

We have multiple vendors we created earlier, so let me select two or three vendors from that.

It's a company called Smart.

So it is having six entries.

So let me select both.

Choose one and I'm sending this click on Enter so that it will take the details from the event manager

and the concept.

Message controls.

We will discuss it later.

Okay.

Because whenever we create any transaction data, it would be transferred to the vendors.

Right.

So we need to send through either fax or mail or some medium, right.

So that medium, we need to be defined.

We have a separate concept called output determination concept.

During that time, I will explain about this.

Okay.

Just click on sale.

So one out of two was sent to Bush.

So let me sell it to another vendor we need to send to the multiple vendors.

Again, You need to set it another year.

Let me select endurance.

And.

Sid?

Yes.

So it has center and it doesn't know that the window.

In the.

It is.

The window is ending for members.

It is like this.

What models?

The Senate.

So we send you to the four vendors.

Now, we created multiple excuse here after sending these invitations.

If you want to see the list of rescues, so let me fall into.

You can see the list of lot of Qs.

You going expect?

See.

On one, on one on one.

This is the collector number here.

You can see the number and it is sent to the multiple vendor we created for our SKUs.

And with multiple vendors, you can see the multiple vendors numbers, right See here one models.

We are sent piston and distributor loading.

What are the materials and Wind industries Engineers Technologies Bosch Ltd.

We send foreign annotations to the.

My 14 rotations to defenders.

Right.

So after that, the vendors will hold their prices either through mail or fax or something then.

The users will maintain that in a safe system.

So far, maintaining that we use the transaction code called MI 47, MI 47, MI 47.

And here we need to maintain the purchased RFQ number and we will maintain the prices.

First of all, let me check the prices of the materials and then we can maintain what?

21.

I check this material?

But this material, the price is 2000 Special prices, ₹2,000.

So let's assume let me put multiple prices out of gas and then distributed forwarding.

Right.

What is its price?

Is 400 holding prices, 400 and patience prices to those.

National need for this.

Okay.

For first order models and share, you need to put the price.

So putting it like this.

Each.

Yeah.

Okay.

Net price.

Here.

Let's assume that each system costs ₹2,000 so that Warren Morris is giving for 9090.

He's decreasing 10,000.

Distributed voting is ₹400 is giving for three Nigerians.

And.

Now click on.

Okay.

And then the second RFQ in the industries, what they were quoted.

For each 980 and three eight.

Let us decrease the ten ₹10.

So.

And then endurance technologies.

This vendor is giving for 1970 and 37.

And last quotation.

So he's leaving 360 and.

So.

360 and 96.

And so we maintain the quotations which quoted by the vendors you quoted that we maintain that quotations

in.

But of respect to RFQ.

Now we need to compare the prices.

Now we have it and the transaction code and me 49 where we can compare the prices.

Here.

We have seen that killing two out of four and one is a collector of you in Connecticut.

So it is a the.

Vendors based on the price we maintain.

See it is given the strength for.

Disband six serious parties because he'd given the list price C 1960 and 360.

And then the second rank is given for 1970 and 37 and next prize is given for 1983 1993.

The last.

But I think he's given to this vendor and the company will not consider the prices as the factor they

will consider as the quality.

Also another factor the qualities must ensure right for the manufacturing.

We need to have better quality raw materials so they will consider quality as well.

And also company has to consider the if they want to buy a bulk quantity.

Also, the vendor has the capability and also they will in real time.

They will not take the parameter from the same vendor.

They will select multiple vendors, they will choose some two vendors from this poor vendor.

Also, they can revise the orders to the multiple vendors and they will procure the materials.

This is how we compare the prices.

Any questions, Joseph?

Okay.

There is a small doubt though, when Dharamsala when the email demand which is then we can send out

to other people as well as the other.

Oh, no, no, no, not like that.

For example, if they are, I mean, we can send a through mail or else or else we directly print out

this form and we attach to the mail and we can send it to the.
