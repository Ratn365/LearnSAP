In this today's session, we will discuss about the master data concept and the company.

They need to run some transactions for their business.

So in order to run the transactions, they must need to have the master data.

Okay, so what type of what type of master data that the business required that the companies required

NMM as part of SD and all of the things in coming to a part.

We have some kind of master data like material, master data, vendor, master data, some purchase

info record on the source list.

Let me note it so that we can see.

In a module.

We have a material master data.

Then the master data.

And but choosing for the code.

Record purchasing for record stores list.

And then ServiceMaster data.

And then we have some code amendment as it was more data.

Mostly these file Marshall letters would be used by most of the organizations displayed.

So this court arrangement will be used.

Like many cases, they use this concept called arraignment.

For example, this will be used by the 100%, 100% micro Marshall data.

Marshall Data will be available in every organization that's come under in for the courts and service

Marshall data.

It will be usable around 80% of organizations coming to court arraignment like 5% or 10%.

That's it.

So it doesn't have much importance like a quarter, and we will discuss it also in the classes.

First, let's look into this significance of metal master data today.

After that, we will discuss about data mining master data.

So today we are going to discuss about the master data, see metadata.

It means like it will handle all the materials in metal match data, like what type of data we maintain

is like what is the name of the material and what is a material number.

Every material is some unique number assigned to it.

What is a material number and what is the unit of measure?

For example, if we go with the food processing virus, it will be calculated in cases.

For example, if you go on by a pen or pencil, it will be calculated in each case.

But the metal can be measured in pounds.

You have some unit of measures that also we will maintain the master data under some of the data.

Also, we will maintain that I will show you in step and I will explain you about that.

And in Metal Master Data, how many metal types?

OC Metal types is nothing but like raw materials, finished materials, semi-finished materials.

These are called metal types.

And also we will maintain some hierarchies will be covered in metal master.

We maintain a hierarchy like.

I like, you know, material type.

So bare metal type material group.

And then we will maintain.

This is how we maintain.

The higher level.

So what is the matter type?

We all discussed about that, whether it is the raw material, raw material.

It's been used to finish material.

Yes.

Mean, I think you already have.

And all is about the same definition.

Some trading goods, some non value stocks, etc..

This is we call this raw materials.

So the based on the business also diagram, it is unfinished parts.

Maybe that is for example, if you go with the car manufacturing companies, the car will be the final

product, but for its parameters will be the engines, piston core ties, the steel body glasses.

These are common parameters, right?

But if you go to the engine manufacturing company, the final product will be the engine.

Its diameters will be like piston inlet valves.

These are come under the parameters.

So based on the business, also the meters, maybe bearings do not count.

Do not fix it.

Like the engine means it is automated.

If it is an engine manufactured company, the final product will be the engine.

If it is a car manufacturing company, the engine will be the raw material.

Okay.

Yeah, I'm coming to material groups.

It is also, say, based on the business, they will be grouped together, the materials based on their

attributes.

Like, for example, there will be club together.

All the mechanical items come under one group.

All the collectors come under one meter of group.

Okay?

Or else they will go with all the metal items as the one group, all the plastic items as a one metal

based on their business requirement, they will create the metal groups.

For example, let us go with the mechanical items because we are doing the project of a Honda motorcycle.

So it's a manufacturing company, of course.

So let's go with this mechanical items, something like the items that say something like this.

It's a for a business purpose.

Let's assume it's coming to material.

So under this metal group, under these mechanical items for how some items like shop shop come under

mechanical item and shop piston gear level.

Except these are common mechanical items when it comes to electrical items like cables, cables, small

small bulbs, bulbs.

So how can cause we have some LEDs, write the articles like some kind of engine spark this kind of

electrical wires.

What are the cables we use?

These are common electrical items.

Okay, Under this metal groups also we create the materials.

Okay, This is a higher level we made.

In Middlemarch.

It is just a theoretical, theoretical part of Metro data.

Let us go into the SEP and we will do the configuration and we will create the materials.

So that me go logging into the Sep.

Okay, So for every configuration, we have only a single transaction that is SPRO in that we need to

go to the ACP Reference Agency.

Now we are going to.

Do the configuration part of metal.

So if we want to create the materials, what are the requirements we need see here?

What are the requirements you need?

We need to have a material number.

Every time you create the material, it will be having some material number assigned to it.

So we need to have some material number, which so and as it will be, how it needs to have some length,

whether it is a four digit code, whether it is a code, whether it's a ten digit code, if you go with

the item item or debit card or credit card and some 16 digits or something.

So every thing have some length of it, right?

You need to define that length.

After that, we need to define the number range.

That means you want the matrix from 0 to 100 or from 0 to 1000 or 0 to 10000.

What are the metals range?

You need to maintain that.

After that, we need to define the metal types in business, whether they were using the raw materials,

finished materials and finished.

We need to define them.

After that, we need to define the material group.

And we need to assign all of them for the configuration part, and then we will create the material.

No, It is a path for the Marshall Plan for creation.

See here.

We need to go for logistic chain.

Here you can see logic, gender.

Go to that logic, gender.

And here you can see the metal master go to the metal master.

After that, you can see the basic settings go to the basic settings.

Here.

It has an defined output format for mental numbers.

We can't execute

here for easy system.

The maximum length is 18 digits only.

The maximum length ACP provided is 18 digits.

If you want to change the length also, you can change it.

It's not a problem, but based on the business requirement, we change in the.

See the business is using the ten digit number for material only then we will change it to the ten OC

and yeah, OC Maxim 18.

But coming to us for HANA, the SAP is getting advanced now.

Coming to us for Hana it's material.

And this 40 to 40, it increased to 40.

It can maintain up to 46 OC So do not disturb anything because the seams are really bad.

So many people, so do not disturb anything.

The standard configuration if you want.

I want to let you know how we maintain the length of it.

OC do not disturb anything.

I will go back.

If you want to maintain you can change OC.

It's not a problem.

It's a business requires the client to maintain the length of the material is only ten digits.

Then you go with you go on, maintain your S10, go back.

So we do not we do not change anything to come back.

If you want, you can make these changes.

After that, we need to maintain some company codes for materials management.

You can see maintain company codes for metals management.

Click on Execute.

Yeah.

What is our company code here?

It's not like these are called period indicators.

These are called period indicators.

It will be changed.

For example, it is around 20, 22/4 month.

Right.

So we need to change that.

We have a separate transaction.

I will explain that.

How to change this period.

Go back now.

Go to medieval times.

And here you can see the fine attributes of material types You can.

It is nothing but the metal type that raw materials finish product.

How different kind of materials like the ACP are already given the standard material here.

For raw materials, its code is artwork for finished material.

Its code is.

If I see me finish these.

And you can see.

It shall be.

See me finish work and I can go without a hitch.

It means if I see you go with a finished product, it is a Fiat, as if we already provided some standard

configuration.

Someone has changed up the description.

Change the description.

Okay.

Someone has put their name over there.

So I changed it.

That's it.

Okay.

That is the finish goods.

So these are our standard material types that ACP already had.

But in real time we use the same standard metal types.

Most of the cases we use, if they need any changes in the existing standard, they will go with the

customized metal types.

It is nothing, but they simply copy the standard and they will maintain in front of the code as Z.

That's it.

If you see, for example, if you go and maintain customization for material, for example, which is

the material.

Okay.

Select.

These are material that.

Here you can see the copy button.

Click on copy.

And you can hear change the last time.

We already copied some plans and we maintain some new plant code as the same way we will maintain our

example I maintaining a Z.

This is a code.

Yes.

I've been maintenance on the committee and.

See is copying now.

I've been in this cockpit.

Why we we can use arrowheads metal type.

So it's not a problem.

Why we are doing this means the same as the standard metal that will be used by so many users in this

server.

So if they do any changes in the standard, so it will impact our process as well.

So that is a reason why we are customizing this.

Simply copying it and put Z as in front of it.

If you see in real time, also if you see an Z wad in a safe system, that means someone has customized

that.

Metal type or whether it is anything in CEP.

If you see it, start with Z.

That means he has done some customization there.

You must remember that OC.

That he makes some screen level change outs or anything.

If they want to do some customization activity like the standard behavior is not satisfying the business,

then they will go and do the customizations.

Okay.

You understand, Joseph?

If the standard functionality is not satisfying the client business process, then they will do the

customizations.

And also it requires that every time if you do any customizations, you need to put Z in front of it.

Z Because if anybody sees that, that means someone had done the customization over here so that they

will easily identify because Z is not used as standard.

If you see any standard names in the system, they do not start with Z.

That's the reason why the ACP recommends you to maintain the Z in front of it.

If you've done any customizations yourself.

Yeah.

Yes.

So I copied out of his to zero.

So this is our parameter on parameter.

Now select this raw material and click on this quantity by value updating folder.

Go to it.

So many entries were copied because we already copied from existing.

That is the reason so many entries were copied.

The composition and composition and valuation Valuation.

I already told you that.

What is our valuation area planned?

Right.

So we need to maintain the plant as our valuation rates.

So it is such for our valuation area, and especially here, you need to select quantity building and

value updating.

Why we are doing this?

Because whenever you receive the material in your stores, the system needs to update the quantity.

Along with their value elsewhere.

Right.

So if you check these boxes, then only it will update the quantity into every warehouse.

Plant.

Plant.

That is the reason why we are checking it.

If you do not check these, then the system won't allow you to update the quantity or value.

Okay.

That's the reason why you must check these boxes.

See here.

Quantity updating and Value update.

Now see.

And then select this zero and go to details.

That means it is it is having some controls in this parameter type as well.

See, here it is having some field difference.

We have some configuration activity in the backend system, like what is the field difference and the

screen reference.

If you see if you're feeling anything, it would be some mandate receipts.

If you see START fields will be available.

Some will be optional fields.

Some fields will be in display mode.

We can't enter anything in that field.

If you see zero, you can't maintain anything, right?

It is in display mode.

That means you can't.

It is not in editable mode.

And also you can see some fields are mandatory.

Like if you're filling any forms or something in Google or something.

Some fields are showing as mandatory start symbols, right.

So that those controls can be maintained at field reference.

I will show you that as well.

Okay.

This build is cross planned metal status.

It means we can block this material type or as few kind of functionalities will be available.

Blockade for procurement for approval release.

This kind of metal status will be available so that we can maintain it.

For example, I don't want this metal type needs to be used.

Then I can come here and I will block this material.

Metal type OC That is how the metal status we can maintain here.

And also these are called views OC During the creation of material, we need to select some use.

For example, if we are procuring the material, we need to have some purchasing views.

If you are selling the materials, we need to maintain some data in sales views.

Okay.

So those views, what are the views you need?

You need to select those views here.

OC For example, parameter, we are purchasing the raw material from external sources.

Then you need to have some purchasing data in metal master data.

So you need to select the purchasing view here.

If you want to maintain the material description, what is a unit of measure of it?

You need to maintain that.

You need to have some basic data view.

OC So all these views are some standard functionality.

Okay, do not make any changes.

I want you to let you know what these user departments means.

You need to select these views.

What are the views you are required in this configuration?

OC I'm coming to here Internal pay action or purchase orders.

That this metal type is actually used for actual procurement or in-house manufacturing.

You need to maintain here, for example, actual purchase orders.

See here.

No purchase orders allowed, but warning message issued or actual purchase allowed.

If you are procuring from external sources, it will be giving some warning message like it is actual

purchasing orders.

It doesn't require any warning messages.

We are simply procuring all the parameters from the actual sources.

Then you can select us to purchase orders.

If you select zero means it does not allow you to create the purchase orders.

That is the control of it.

And also same internal purchase orders as well.

If you do any internal manufacturing in-house purchase orders, you can create or not you can maintain

here.

And also we'll be having the price controls.

If you maintain here, it will be taken as by default during the creation of Metal Master.

I will explain that.

What is this price control?

What is this moving average and what is the standard price?

I mean, in the coming.

So when we are creating the metal, I will tell you that what is this price control under the category

difference?

And that's we will discuss about this later.

If I tell you now, you will be a little bit confused.

I will tell you this field in the fact that classes.

See here.

Quantity dating and value of dating how it is updating for all validation areas you need or else you

want to need a particular valuation area or not.

You can maintain that control here.

For example, if you select this in all valuation area, that means it will be applicable for all the

plans, not only on the plan, it will be applicable for all the plans.

If you want a particular plan, then you need to select this option and you need to check the boxes

here.

That is the control of.

And also X number assignment we thought we would discuss like during the maintenance for number ranges

in the configuration.

In the next configuration, I will explain that what is national number and what is internal number?

Okay.

Go back home.

See, everything was in Berlin.

If I tell you right now, then it will be a little bit confusing for you.

That's the reason I left some fields during the process and during the creation of transactions, you

will be understand better.

So we defined one material type.

And let me copy that material as well.

We use both the material.

So let me copy this.

Finished goods that we maintain as the 40.

For example, Honda

and.

This.

Again, it is taken zero.

Oh, I think both were selected.

So that is it.

Both was copy.

Same.

I was selected zero.

And also we have here that is there is a.

Sorry, Joseph.

What is it?

You've been selected both raw material and finished goods.

Yeah, that's the reason why it is copied.

But I can't sell it.

I can't see.

Okay, so.

See.

See here.

That fact was copied as Z for.

No, Come on, keep updating.

I want to do quality and value updating for our clients.

It's been 11.

Okay, now save this told the data was saved so major types was defined.

But we are using the raw materials and also we are using the materials.

Now we need to maintain the number system.

After that, we define the metal types.

Now we need to have some number inside every time we create material.

We need to have some number of pinch.

Every time if it were metal, we need to have some number range.

See here you can see define number range for each material type.

They can exude in real time.

What happens is, you know, for example, I will show you that number and just click on display so

that you can see you can see small speck, speck, symbol.

Speck symbol means it is nothing but display.

If you see the pencil button, it is in change mode.

I'm displaying the intervals.

What are the intervals?

Intervals is not in that number in this case.

See here.

And these are call number ranges here, having so many number range.

CC We are having system number ranges.

But in real time, what happens is these many number ranges are you are not use we use the sequence

pattern like one series is used for raw materials to series.

You use it for finished materials like three series usually used for some trading goods for series is

use it for some non stock items like that.

We will maintain a series level so that every time if you see the ones it is so it is a metal belongs

to diameter like that.

By seeing itself by viewing itself, you can understand whether it is raw material or finished.

For we it is nothing but a best practice.

So but it is a test server so many users are creating randomly and that is another way it is showing

in some clumsy OC, but in real time it will be having some kind of some hierarchy level.

We can we will maintain.

OC

Let us create one new number range.

Okay.

First of all, click on this pencil mark group.

First, we need to create one group like whether it is a metal group or finisher group.

And in that group we will maintain one number range and then we will assign that group to the metal

then.

It is a little confusing, right?

Totally.

I will write it out in here.

We will define something like material group, for example, Fonda

Group.

This group will be assigned to.

Number.

Okay.

So one group will be created in that group.

We will assign the number range.

After that, what happens is this material group.

There'll be a Santa.

Then what happens?

This number will be assigned to metal type, right?

Right.

We already maintain we already sent the number range, number range to material group.

I'm in the middle group.

Then the same group will be assigned to material type.

Okay, this is not but material.

Typekit.

So then indirectly what we are doing, we are assigning the material type to the number.

So whenever you create a material with respect to the material, then one number will be assigned automatically.

Okay, now we are going to do that.

We can create.

So we are defining one group, for example, on the.

Score.

Let us maintain some group.

Here.

Here we need to maintain the number.

But if you give the existing number range, what are the other users maintain?

It will throw an error.

The number range is already existed.

So what we need to do when to maintain here, What are the numbers?

What are the number?

Is that not used by the other users you need to maintain?

Right.

So in order to do that, click on intervals, click on existing so that the system will solve what are

the existing intervals.

So these are called existing intervals.

Put the cursor here.

Click on ascending order so that it will be visible in ascending order so that it can be easy for you

to maintain.

For example, to maintain a series table.

You state series.

This is the last number in the use.

Let us do one thing.

We will use the nine cities.

Okay.

Let us go with nine cities.

Yeah.

Okay.

Nine cities.

Some number is 930 something.

So, so much of land.

I think they were using 88 inches this competition.

Yes, yes, yes.

Right.

Because we maintain eight inches this land.

Right.

If you do not maintain eight inches, also, it will maintain some zeros in front of the number of zeros

will be, for example, if you go and see existing number as initially see here, they were using some

ten one quarter something the zeros that come right.

So the length will be 18 only.

What are the your number maintain the length will be taken as 18 characters automatically picks up I

think eight digits.

Yes.

Right.

What are the length you maintain?

Yes.

Let us do one thing that is maintain.

It has a thousand up 2000.

It's enough us to create a thousand materials.

Let us go and do those.

Yes.

Now I'm saving this scene.

The number was assigned automatically at 17, but because the 16 number range already maintains, so

it is taken automatically 70 number range.

I'm saving this.

But then what happens?

We told you that once it is resolved, materials will say this is for finished materials like the remainder.

Okay.

The data was saved.

Go back now.

Duh.

Finish medical.

Q&A underscored.

CFR.

So we already know the last number and what we maintained.

So that let us take from this number.

From 2001.

Some full of dust.

See?

What is the difference between actual internal?

I will.

I will tell you that.

Here you can see some x external box.

If you check, this means it is called actionable number.

If you do not check means it is called internal number range.

First of all, we will create the internal number.

So it has 18 character.

That data was set.

That is the one thing we will create the actual numbering as well so that you can understand it.

What is the difference between external and internal?

I think this in itself we can end.

Here.

Our groups.

I think what is see it is take an automated ambulance.

But because we already maintain the internal the system already to automatically take index number.

I think we maintain photos and

maintain as a.

4001.

For example.

This is the actual number.

Okay.

So we defined this part.

We created one metal group and we assigned some member range to it.

Whether it is external or internal, now we are going to assign it to promote it or finish it.

First of all, let us find our metal types first.

If we can't find butter.

And what is our zero, Right.

And.

Click on it.

So that will.

Oh, sorry.

I clicked.

You can't find butter and zero zero available here.

Here you can see small rectangular box.

You can see right highlighted.

And then click on element by group assignment.

Click on it.

And we need to search for our group.

What is our group?

Honda Zero.

Like these aren't hunting.

What is the next one?

Zephyr.

Finish.

Yes.

Yeah.

Select the second so that it will search for the third and second element assignment group.

And then you need to set it our finished group.

Now, if you go down, you can see the assignment.

See.

A group was assigned to me.

The group was assigned to Major.

If you double click on this material group, then it will.

It will show you the number range.

Okay.

This is how we need to assign the matter to number range.

After that, what we need to do, we need to define the groups of of groups.

Right.

See here.

Hierarchy metal type is created and its assignments also completed.

Now we are going to create the group.

Closest major types.

Go to settings for key fields.

Here you can see defined material groups.

Click on Execute.

To set up all metal groups.

Let us go and create some new entries like on the that maintenance Mac OC.

So maintenance on the items, which underscores

the guidance on business, we maintain these groups.

Okay, articulate.

I'll see.

Okay, then we need to have a purchasing group as well.

We already defined that purchasing information during the creation of enterprise structure.

So no, we don't acquire that.

So the configuration was completed.

So now we can create the material for creation of material, everything.

We need to have some transaction quotes here because we call it a transaction quote, a purchase order.

You already know that you don't do an end your end user.

You're using the transaction site.

Those are nothing but transaction costs for creation of material.

The transaction code is zero.

They will want to change the material for the existing material.

The transaction code is zero.

If you want to display.

You don't want to.

Yes.

If you don't want to display I mean, you don't want to change anything and you want to see in display

mode, that means it is not intended to promote eligible mode, then the transaction code is unknown.

Zero three.

If you want to see the list of materials, total materials.

Under the plan.

You want to see what the details like that you want to see, Then you will use the section 16.5 that

is also I thing.

So this is those are commander under like valuations.

How much the value of the material will be.

It does not give you what is the metal type, what is the metal group, what is the description of it.

These kind of things will not be displayed or it will be showing how much stock will be available in

the store location.

Yes.

Yes.

All of the evaluation of the installation.

Yes.

Yes.

Those will be we will discuss in other classes.

Now, let us create one material now.

I will open another session ASAP.

Having total succession can open at a time maximum.

So I mean, I'm open and decision giving here is in zero one and it will take you to the create material

initial screen.

Okay.

Here you can see material.

Industry sector material type change number material if you want to create I mean, if you want to create

with reference to any any other material, you can maintain that material here.

We will discuss these things later.

First of all, let us create one material.

Select the industry sector.

What kind of industry is the business like?

Whether it is a cement industry, chemical industry, pharmaceutical industry, chemical industry,

or we have we are using some mechanical and core manufacturing.

So we go with the mechanical engineering and metal type.

What is our material type zero?

This is a yes, you can see the metal types here are which all the metal types will be available here,

but we defined one zero.

Zephyr de to finish.

Right.

So let us select this material.

And now click on Select Views.

Others you can simply enter.

Also, it will directly open the views.

Click on the select views.

It will ask What are the kind of views in the unit?

We are having basic data view sales views.

If the model is belongs to sales, then you need to maintain some data relevant for sales.

If the model is relevant for purchasing, you need to maintain the purchasing data and also its storage

location data or its accounting you like.

I will select the RM views now.

We'll discuss about the remaining views later.

Select the basic data one.

View Basic data to purchasing.

And store location views.

We do not maintain any data.

Most probably store locations, but just maintain the store location views and.

How to sell their country view is nothing but the price of the material.

What are the general ledger accounts needs to hit?

What is the valuation Plus, we need to maintain in accounting.

If I now continue.

Whenever I click continue, it will ask under which plan you want to create this material and which

storage location you want to create this material.

Like that, the system will ask, you see and click on Continue.

The system will ask under which plan you want to create.

It's B.

C under which plan you want to create, under which to read location.

You want to create this material like that the system is asking.

So let B maintain it is HB one under this plan, under the storage location.

One I want to create this material and continue.

She had.

The nine series was automatically assigned.

That means our material assignment is working Now that we maintain here it is some level of something.

Something.

For example, Question I'm creating one piece of material and it's based unit of measure based unit

of here.

You need to maintain the description of it and then basing it on my measure, it is nothing but stock

keeping unit.

How the company will manage or measure the material in store.

Location is nothing but based on message.

The question will be calculated in maybe inches each based on cost.

If it is a related thing.

We call it in later.

Yeah, maybe for some other.

Maybe you can use like PCs phones.

So many you enterprises will be available.

Right.

Cages.

Based on the material.

The measure may be varies, so patients will be calculated in inches each, of course.

If you want to check for it here, you can see small button, right click on it.

So it will show you the list of basic measures necessary.

See so many square inch cubic inch, percent days, micrometer and ampoules, bag barrel bottles.

So many, so many measures available.

But we require each site.

So let us search for each.

Each is.

So I maintain based on Thomas and metal.

It is belongs to mechanical items.

So let us select the mechanical item group.

Honda Mechanical.

I think this has to underscore

I'm selecting this material group or material number.

See, this field is referencing model.

Yes, right.

It is a reference number because I see you're using some other software or something you implement it

as.

After that, the metal numbers are changed from numerics to like in previously.

They are using 1 to 3.

Now they are using ABC OC.

But the you the water, the users, they are creating the purchase orders or something.

They were very familiar with the all metal numbers.

Okay.

So what we do is we simply put that all material reference numbers here so that the users will easily

identifies OC.

That is the reason why we put the reference metal number, which is all material number they are using

that we can put it here OC.

An actual metal group is nothing.

But like, for example, the company is using some third party warehouses, not their own warehouses.

They are using some third party warehouses for their business purposes.

They don't have plan.

For example, they don't have a plant in Bangalore.

Storage store is the location of something.

They don't have it in Bangalore, but they use I mean, so many people are buying their products in

Bangalore.

So they are using some third party warehouses.

But according to our business process, we call it is a mechanical items.

But according to the third party warehouse, they're using like metal items, plastic items.

So that purpose, we can maintain that actual metric here.

You understand yourself.

What is the meaning of metal?

Of metal, then?

Yeah, a division.

It's a common model.

Okay.

Division is nothing but in prospect too.

They will be having some divisions.

Like without having some metal groups.

They will have some divisions.

Okay.

On cross plan material status.

It is nothing.

But if you want to block this material for procurement or anything, you can maintain it here, can

see the statistics.

If you click on this button, you can see list of status available for it.

To see what the status of C block for procurement block or for possible stuff bomb so obsolete this

kind of status, what are the status you want to maintain this material?

You can define those statuses and you can maintain it here.

And CrossFit network.

What is the difference between CrossFit and CrossFit means or overall weight of the material?

For example, let me tell you a small example.

You buy, you bought some oil packet.

The oil is crazy, but the water, the packet we're having, it will be having some data.

For example, the packet we bought is crazy.

Let me let me.

Let me tell you.

If I purchase like a liter of oil in that CrossFit will be included with the tin.

Tin Tin?

Yes.

But when it comes to be oil, which.

Yes, right.

That is what the difference between CrossFit and that for example, the piston weight is, for example,

fixing.

Okay.

For example, that £5,000 or something.

Let me put it £5,000.

You know, grams would be a C And if you want to go with the Jay-Z or something, for example.

Well, it doesn't.

800 grams is the net weight of the.

This is how we can maintain order.

We can maintain what is the net weight and what is the grass fed.

We need to maintain it here.

And as a defining this, we will discuss it later.

If they tell you now, it will be a little bit confusing for you.

And then you can see here what are the views we selected.

It is having some dot symbols.

So if you go with the.

You selected purchase annuities having some dot symbol.

We set a distorted location behind some dot symbols.

What other you selected, it will be selected here.

And when we can enter, it will be skipped to what are the next to selected view?

Enter.

It will go on to the.

It's dated here.

The data is much secured here.

We can maintain that if the item is relevant for any other ideas, then we can maintain here some data

here.

If it is relevant for environmentally, if it is a chemical item, if exposed to environment, it is

affecting environment.

These kind of things we can maintain.

Okay, click on Enter so that it will skip to the next select review here.

The base unit of measure.

It will be copied from basic data.

One you and here you can see all the unit.

What do you mean by this order unit for example, the question we calculated in our warehouses is when

you are buying externally, the company does not buy each piston, right?

It will be buying huge quantity like whether it is 120 or 220 or something.

Maybe it can be bought 1000 contacts.

So for ordering it will be bulk, but the vendor is telling like I'm selling in a quantity in a bunch

of boxes we are selling.

Like for example, the metal is expensive, it is a pencil company.

We need pencil.

So the vendor is not selling the each pencil, right?

He was selling it boxes.

Each box is having some ten pencils.

If you want to buy it, you need to buy in boxes like that.

He will tell to you.

Then you need to put that order unit here.

For example, I'm putting here one box in one box.

Let me select the box then how the system will behave.

Let us see.

Let us find that box.

Fine.

See a cardboard box or something.

Let us select this box.

Okay, I selected box.

Then click on Enter.

We'll put the purchasing group Who is the person is responsible to procure this material?

HP Z.

Honda by and we created one but Jason.

See under blocks.

When I click on Enter the System asks in one box how many inches or maintaining.

You need to maintaining.

You need to tell to the system, see if they can enter.

It will ask in one box how many inches you are maintaining.

See, when pop up windows came right in one box, how many inches you are making?

That is in like ten inches.

I mean, in one box, ten pictures were maintained by the vendor.

We are procuring products.

We are issuing also in one box.

Can it just be maintained like that?

We can tell to the system.

And.

See we maintain the order unit and also plant metal status.

The same in basic that is seen right some status that is relevant for client level.

It is relevant for plant level.

If you want to block for a particular brand, you need to maintain the status here.

If you want to block the material for entire all the plants, then we can maintain the status and paste

data

and automatic people.

Batch management batches, Value keys.

These are all things we will discuss in later sessions.

If we tell you now will be you will be having some little bit confusion like based management is a different

concept.

Automatic people.

When you are creating a PR, the people will be created automatically.

It is one of the of the concept parties value key here.

We can maintain the vendors reminders to the vendors and shipping instructions.

Like if you buy this material material from the vendor, you can maintain some shipping instructions.

Please follow these rules while shipping the material to us like that.

You can maintain these kind of things We will discuss in further topics.

When you creating the transaction data, we will discuss it.

Now you can enter.

This is a storage location.

Nothing is required here to maintain Lebanon.

And taken into account.

It is very, very important.

It's very important to us and also for people, as it is the integration part of an effort here to maintain

the valuation chain.

We have a separate concept called media integration, like automatic account determination.

During that topic, I will explain what is the value trust?

What is the significance of it?

I will explain with that.

Okay.

Just simply understood.

We need to assign this valuation class here.

Whenever you run the transactions, it will be hit some gender based on this valuation trust.

Just remember this.

We have a separate concept.

I will explain you that.

So.

See here, we have a different kind of valuation parameters.

So based on this valuation across each valuation class, we will be maintaining differentiated accounts

by the business requirements.

Here you can see the metal type description itself things like volume, deployments, domestic implements,

import.

If you are procuring this material from other countries, it is not importing.

Right.

So during that point of time we will select this 301 like that.

We can maintain different categories.

We will discuss it.

And I told you that we will discuss the price control during the creation of material.

Right.

See, it is kept.

We automatically.

Why it is kept, we automatically.

I didn't maintain anything because in material type I think we are to open that.

No, I mean, opening it up so that how we're taken out, I will show it.

Metal types defined attributes of material types.

Let us take our major step, for example, zero

and go into details.

Here we maintained it has moving average price.

Oh, also the system automatically taken.

It has a V here.

That is the reason we take taken automatically.

If you want to change the price control, you can change it.

So let me tell you the what is the significance of this price control?

It will be having two types of price controls.

One is moving average price and second one is standard price.

C What is the business of it?

Let me explain that.

C Moving at this price, we maintain like the meter, whenever the metal price is fluctuates.

I mean, that is every time like within a one month or a period of time the metal price is changing.

Then we can maintain it as a moving average price.

The meter price is not changing every minute.

Every time within a month, the price not be changed.

Then it can be changed within a year or six months.

Then we can maintain it as a standard prize.

And also the business is like the raw materials is procured from external sources.

So the prices varies from vendor to vendor.

Right.

So the separate commands to maintain moving average price to raw materials.

And that's what the ACP recommends to maintain standard price to finish product because finished product

will be manufactured by us.

So the price will be fixed by the company.

So it is nothing but a standard price.

Okay.

You understand, Joseph, what is the difference between moving out as price and standard price?

Let me give a small example.

Like if you go with the petrol over time, the price will be changes every week, right?

It is nothing but a moving average price.

So if you go and buy some laptops, it will be having some standard price about 50,000 or something.

It will be changed, but it has some duration of time right after then only it will be changes.

That is a difference between standard price and moving average price.

And also ACP recommends and so the business recommends to maintain parameters, you need to maintain

the moving average price.

And for finished product you need to maintain standard price.

Why?

Because parameters will be procured from external sources.

It can be varies from vendor to vendor, but it does not have the ability to the company to control

it.

Right.

But for this standard, for the finished product, it will be manufactured by us.

We know the what is the price of the what is the cost of the final product.

So it is can we analyze what were the landed cost?

I mean, a lot of the charges you're asking.

Yeah.

Transportation from the manifest, from the dispatch tool to the manufacturing unit.

What The total landed cost and the manufacturing costs.

See, the transportation costs will be charged separately.

Right.

We will maintain that separately During the procuring trials, we pay the charges.

If we include that in.

In the final product, the business required.

Based on the companies, we maintain that.

And also are after the finished product.

We will also charge the transportation charges right to the customer.

Yes.

Yes, right.

If you sell a product, you will be charging the right.

If you buy the product.

Also, you will have some transportation charges.

If you buy if you sell it at the hand, some transportation charges.

Okay.

We will talk about later.

During the creation of people, we have some conditions where we can maintain that transportation charges,

fight charges, we call it as a fight charges,

so that we maintain a moving average price here, because the ACP also mandates be for raw materials

and price of the material.

So if you're maintaining the then you need to maintain the price in moving price field.

If you maintain standard price control, then you need to maintain the price.

Standard price.

Okay.

Let me maintain the let's assume the cost is around 3000 so that maintain some.

And going can entertain the views of the selected views are completed.

No system ask.

Do you want to save your data?

Yes.

I never say you save the material.

Be creative.

See?

So demonstrators created.

So let me know if you want to change anything.

And metal modulator, you have a transaction called.

M0 to selection and zero why I'm using slash and here slash and is used to kill the current screen and

it will open the new screen.

Okay.

Slash.

It means it will kill the current screen, for example, you see.

It will be having some three views.

Right.

Let me close this another session by behind two sessions.

Now, ironically, current.

It will open till it kills the current session and it opens.

But I don't want to disturb this session and I want to open a new session means I will go with slash

or slash and means it will kill the current transactions and it will open current transaction, which

if you use slash law.

Yeah.

Slash romance.

It reopens in another session and it does not disturb the current session.

C and then zero three.

It will open in another session.

See?

See?

Let me give you.

See, I maintain the material number.

Click on Enter so that it will see what are the views you want to display that will select basic data

purchasing and accounting.

And for plan, you need to maintain its p one and.

See it is a non eligible mode, right?

Because here it is in non editable mode.

If I want to go and change the material later, then you can go with Slash and Zero to end.

And for example.

But things can change.

For example, basically the one I want to change it.

But I've got some changes I have done.

I changed so dramatically.

What's changed?

If you want to change the material later, you can change.

And if you want to see the list of meteors, but we have only single material, it will be displaying

only a single material.

And I'm 60.

Under this plan.

For example, under SPL one, we want to see the list of materials we can execute.

Then it will show the list of materials, not just one thing.

Let us create another material, finish material.

Let us create finished material.

See here it will be showing the material data.

What is the price?

What is the valuation?

What is the precious metal metal type?

Let us do one thing.

Let us create another material, finish product, create the finished product zero.

Let us create the event.

Enter basic data want to purchase and.

Distorted Location one.

Distorted Location two.

And.

Plus the plant and store location.

Continue that remain, Dana, for example.

This journey is complicated.

So let's take some meticulous finished product maintenance.

Each metal group.

We already know which Mac.

And.

What is the rate, for example, of some.

I was in drums.

There's something

that partisan groups see in the partisan group is mandate driven.

But here it is, an optional we see.

It doesn't have any mandatory feel here.

If you do not maintenance, it doesn't take anything and get a finished product if you want to maintain

loss in one box.

Higher levels of servicing demand a of.

Location, views and violation costs.

Here, the valuation class will be changed.

See, last time we see 3000 cities.

Right now we can see seven cities.

See seven, nine total.

See here, the price control is a Snow White vacuum that is automatically given.

Now it is giving.

Yes.

Why?

Because there are separate commands for the finished product is standard price.

That doesn't mean something.

Okay.

See 9002 series six came.

So we created one material finish product.

So this is the 6010 section.

And going back.

Now I'm executed.

Then it will surely do maintenance under this plan.

Sea otters if you want to go with the metal type.

But we made an effort.

Then it will show only the finished product.

Yes.

I mean, if it if it is having thousand materials.

A thousand materials, but we created only two materials.

So it will showing only those two materials on.

This is how they create the metal state.

And one more thing.

What is the actual number range.

We didn't talk about it.

But example, what is the number range?

We maintain that is.

If I remember answer material for the groups and.

Commentator.

Sound in 19.

So 19 is the actual number range, right?

So.

So what is that?

19.

I just go with the display mode.

C 19 This is the number Ranger nine six 400 1906 So this is the number range we assigned to the parameter.

For example, I want.

In business process.

What happens is.

They will give the material numbers for each material.

Sometimes some business case.

What happens is we already had some limited numbers.

You need to maintain only those numbers.

I don't want any new material.

How can we maintain that?

Because they will be giving David Wang some a 1 to 3 or something like 1 to 3 for Piston and two or

three for per gearlever.

Then how can we maintain?

Then you need to go with actual number range.

Then for which matter what is the number you want?

You can simply maintain it here and then you can create that material.

For example, nine six 401 It is having nine sales Force one, for example.

I maintain this material number 2001 five material, and then the system won't take it.

See?

Be about as.

Already created.

For example, they put as two, three or something.

For example, they put three.

And then with the metal type action number, it must not contain only numbers, for example, or spectrometer.

They can put 2003 inter.

It is throwing some error.

Right.

Let us do one thing.

Let me maintain this number.

How the system will be healthy

I think number and smart about.

I think we maintain it.

And I'm directly hoping opening the matter type.

Because I know the transaction code.

We can go with the part.

See?

Next number range.

We torture.

Okay.

Now let us maintain this.

See the system as you can see, Right.

The system is allowing to create.

But if I put here as two voluntary three, the system won't allow because why in x number range we maintain

only nine series 4000 193 6006.

So other than this material, the system won't take you to create the material.

So, for example, I want to create with the.

I don't want one.

For example, I want for

the system as a lot to create because then we are then in real time when we are using this sectional

arrangements, then the client needs the specific materials to the specific metal number, to the specific

material.

Then we will use this external material concept.

For example, I for Piston, I don't want a sequence order.

I'm using this is the metal number, the particular piston.

So you need to maintain that metal number only like then the client asks us to maintain.

Then you will go with the external number range.

Okay, Joseph.

Now you can understand it why we are using the internal number range and why we are using this fractional

number range.

If the client specifies that they want this specific number range needs to ascend this particular material,

then you will need to go with the actual number range.

If they don't want, then you can go with the internal reference.
