Today we are going to discuss about the pricing procedure.

We created so many purchase orders, right.

Like the.

So under the purchase order.

Let me share my screen.

Let me show you that.

Okay.

I remember the famous game.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Hello?

So let me show you the.

But.

Thank.

See.

We have taken so many purchase orders for each item.

We maintain some net present based on info record or we can maintain annually.

So if you see an item details, we have a condition tab here.

See, we can see PB double zero means it's a gross price.

It's Katy, which means it's a cash discount.

Like that.

We can see that.

Yeah, that amount is ₹80.

Net price.

₹80.

So if the vendor is having not only price, if he having any taxes or any such charges, but any discounts

that he may have giving us some discounts.

Right.

So at that point of time, we need to define some condition types.

And those conditions will be assigned to some kind of procedure, pricing procedure, which is nothing

but pricing procedure.

Pricing.

It's a concept called pricing procedure.

Where we maintain all the condition which was given by the vendor.

Okay.

They have a standard procedure called item four zeros.

See, let me show you that.

Click on analysis.

This is the pricing procedure.

Name of the pricing.

There is room for standard price increases.

Under this, we are having these many condition types.

One gross price, double zero means automatic price determination.

PBX means manual price determination.

And also, we are having discounts.

When the discounts, surcharges and freight.

If a vendor is delivering to our plant, he will charge some transportation charges.

Right.

So that is not right.

Customs.

If you're procuring from other countries, we need to pay some customs charges, right?

Some.

If you are doing any import procurement activity, we need to pay some.

We need to clear some customs charges.

And like that we have in so many conditions.

So if they're having any input tax, if you if you procuring any material, if the metal having any

tax, you need to pay.

We have a tax condition type is used like that we will have in some kind of condition types here.

It's a standard pricing procedure item for use.

How the configuration is done, I will show you that.

Pricing pressure, as we discussed about output type determination, what is the configuration we do?

We need to have a condition table access sequence, right sequence.

This same way, if you want to define the pricing pressure, we need to have some condition tables,

access sequence.

I will show you that.

Go to Sparco SFP Reference AMG.

Go to metal management.

But choosing.

Conditions last time.

We go for messages, right?

Messages.

So now we are going to create a pricing pressure.

So we need to go to conditions.

At this, you need to go to different price determination process.

See, you need to have a access sequence.

You need to have a condition type.

And we need to maintain condition tables.

Like that, We need to do some configuration activity.

Initially, we need to have some condition table set, go to maintain condition table.

If we want to go for create a new table, we can create.

If you want to see the existing standard tables, click on this button.

You see, these are the list of standard condition tables.

See if you want to go for a.

Send us.

We are having parties in coordination, and that is the combination.

So each table having different kinds of fields.

Where if you want to use those combinations, we can use it.

Okay.

These are the different types of combinations available.

Let's see how the standard configuration has configured.

Let us see.

Go to access sequence.

Define access sequence.

0002 is the standard access sequence selected go to accesses.

See, these are the different types of tables assigned to 0002.

Okay.

Go back.

I mean, if you want to see the fields also that select anyone, go to fields.

Here you can see different kinds of is this vendor is assigned material is assigned purchasing organization

is assigned in full category.

And so the code category was assigned.

These are called access sequences.

And condition types, different condition type.

See, these are the list of condition types available.

Bbwaa is the standard for a grasp and base price of the material, and PBC is also grass praise.

These two are similar for each other, but it is an item.

Debatable determines if the price caught automatically without the manual entry.

Bbwaa will be taken by the SABR system and if the price is not maintained.

So we need to maintain manually rate at that point of time bbwaa will be required.

Okay.

If you want to try to just for even.

We have a different type of standard.

41 is the right charges for even for transportation charges.

Okay, Go back.

These are the list of condition types for standard.

And let us see the fine conflation schema.

Item for Judas, the purchasing document Standard pricing procedure.

To control data.

Let us see.

See how they were maintained.

These are lists of standard condition type assigned to this pricing procedure.

See?

Copy values to comp.

These are the standard configuration, actually.

Okay.

Like if you go for a table, if you know the table interest, so then you can understand it better.

So let's kind this lets you consider this as a standard pricing processor.

Okay.

See if you see it is a print x, actually we have a output determination, right?

If you maintain X on it, then the price will be print in the pure form.

Otherwise it will not print in the pure form.

We define the output type determination, Right.

In the output of determination what we define.

A print form, right?

So in the print from if the price needs to be printed, it needs to be X.

Okay, let me.

Sure you don't ask for.

But in preview.

See?

The press will be printing right here ₹4,080 and the quantity is 50 boxes, right?

When you multiply it, the price will be printing that how it is printing.

If you put X in pricing processor, then only it will be printed in form.

Otherwise it will not print.

Okay.

And this calculations schema.

If it needs to be triggered during the purchase order creation, you need to do some other configuration.

Also, we need to define some schema group vendor and schema purchasing organization and assignment

of schema group to purchasing organization.

Then only this pricing process will trigger here.

This is all about the standard pricing procedure.

Let us go and create a new pricing procedure.

Let us go with the initial steps.

What is the things we do?

First, we need to have a condition payable.

Right.

Then access sequence.

Condition table access sequence.

Then.

What we need to do.

We need to have a condition types.

Then we need to have a cultivation schema.

After that, we need to define schema and schema determination process.

Okay, let us go and see this configuration first.

Initially, we need to have a condition table, right?

At the stake condition table.

To go on and then condition tables.

Create one condition table.

If you want to create a condition table, we can create from here.

Let's take C 0 to 500 is the standard tables.

Okay?

If we want to create a new one, we need to go from 501 to 999.

So let us give anything by 61 or something.

If I 61 table is not available here.

What are the different types of combinations we give?

Like a vendor?

Let us go with vendor.

There is the vendor.

Company could.

Let's go with the company called.

Company could.

One of the things we can give.

Plant.

Okay.

Plant.

And.

It is a window.

I want to go with purchasing automation.

You can give purchasing automation.

Then again, this combination is ideal as a table.

Now click on Generate.

Yes.

Based on local object.

What?

It was generated by 61 paper.

Go back.

Let us display.

Basically, even within the population, is a company called plan Purchasing automation.

And this is the table we define if you want to go another combination.

Also, we can go plan purchasing automation as in another C, let us create another table.

551.

Let us go and create another table call.

562.

Okay.

They give the plant and purchasing organization as another combination.

Plant.

Partisan isn't.

And click on changed.

Plus.

So 561 and 562.

We defined two tables.

So now go and create an access sequence.

Okay.

Let us create a new access sequence, new entries.

So.

Let us give the tables and says, okay, let us take all the combinations of standards and we add the

new entries.

Okay.

Let us take a.

Zero two.

Click on Copy that to stake Delphi Access sequence.

Okay.

And.

And just copy all.

All the indices copying what other tables are available.

It is copying.

Keep on and.

These are available in standard acoustic and

bottle entries were copied selected to access this.

See here these many active sequence tables are assigned here in this access sequence.

I mean, we copied from standard zero right to zero two.

So in table zero two, these many tables were assigned.

We will assign our tables so that here, let us take you and grace so easy.

Number one and two is missing.

Let us give one and two as our tables.

Endless.

One

of the tables we define.

5616562.

And this.

This endless sea.

Company call plant purchasing automation vendor and plant and purchasing automation is the combination

selected go to fields.

And this.

And.

See if it is a green colour means it is good to see the fields automatically taken by the system.

Now go back.

Select seconds will see it is grade or no first table was assigned for them for stable fields.

For now, select second one and go to fields.

And that's.

The plant and purchasing automation also asset.

So it is in green color, the status is green, also in status is green.

So it is good now saved.

So let's say we're doing okay.

Look, it's got.

So now we created a new sequence called the Ask, right?

So what you can

see in real time, we use most of the cases 95%.

We use standard on it.

Okay.

Okay.

Define coefficient schema.

I want I want you to know about how we do these configuration about the pricing.

That's the reason why I'm creating new one.

But in real time we use mostly 95%.

We use standard standard pricing versus.

Let us select I mean, before pricing procedure, we have a condition type, different condition type.

The standard pricing procedure is PB 00c selective.

Go to details can see different kinds of procedures are available.

I mean, controls are available.

These are different kinds of.

If you think someone has changed here.

See someone is changing the standard on.

In the standard standard.

Go back.

It is also standard.

Go back.

To the axis, you contribute zero towards a soundbite.

So in the same way, we need to send our access sequence.

But is this standard right?

So that is the reason why we do not ascend directly to the standard processor here.

So let's copy this condition type.

Copy.

See how we are doing a new configuration.

I will show you.

So you let us take DB double zero.

Okay.

Here.

I can do a selfie.

Cross press.

And what is our exit sequence?

The ask you write.

In fact, the sequence to go check benefactor sequence the concept.

Likewise, we will define different pricing procedures here, and DB is a gross price.

And if you want to create a new flight conditional so we can select it, I can click on copy, I can

give here the pricing new pricing condition type.

No need to create all these things.

Let us go.

With the single condition remaining.

We can take care of the standard ones.

Yeah.

Totally different condition type of sequence.

Now.

Great competitions came up just like this.

Motor control data.

Here you can see the standard condition type sample.

Let's take the same procedure and we will assign our pricing pressures came up.

Click on copy.

You go back once, select the pricing producer and click on copy as we can give.

BMW, something like Delphi pricing procedures.

The.

But isn't.

KOPPEL So all the interests will be copied.

Coleman anticipates having the Coleman entries will be copied, just copied to DM W, now selected and

controlled.

Go to control data.

See here P zero.

Right.

Let us take it as a DB double zero.

We defined a new one, right?

DPW as the LP cross press.

So reminding all our standard.

But in real time.

Also, these can be also maybe going to customers.

They will use Z BW.

They will go with Z, not dock.

So and taken be actually in real time.

If you want to customize anything, you need to go with Z or we do not take any other alphabet.

If it is starting a Z, we need to change the remaining words, but do not use any alphabet other than

Z over.

Let save it.

Go back.

So BMW, as I said, but it needs to be assigned somewhere then only we will get the displacing processor

file.

So go to define schema group.

We need to define one schema vendor.

Schema.

Vendor.

And it needs to be assigned to our regular one.

And we need to define schema organization.

Schema purchasing organization, and we need to ascend to our standard purchasing organization.

And then we need to ascend the schema vendor schema purchasing organization to our cultivation scale.

Okay, then then the pricing processor will automatically determine during the creation of purchase.

Let's see, I'm creating one schema vendor entry I'm in for standard pricing process.

They will give it as a blank here.

If it is a blank, then the price increases are automatically determined.

Okay, standard one because they did not assign anything to any vendor.

That's the reason why in standard price in Brazil, they keep it is a blank.

It is a blank means.

The standard pricing procedure will apply.

Let me show you that.

Also, click on new entries.

Let us create one schema vendor.

LC dv.

Let's take a DV.

Okay.

Then she and.

Go back.

Schema for purchasing organization.

See, we created a schema and right now we need to define schema purchasing

C schema purchasing.

So blank C standard.

So the schema vendor is plan.

This came up in coordination on blank, blank, this blank, this blank and this calculation schema

is assigned then for standard process.

If we are not assigning to any vendor, also the standard pricing processes will apply automatically.

That is the reason why we do not any configuration.

Right.

But how this is determined because for standard pricing processor they will keep it as a blank.

So that is the reason why this pricing procedure is automatically applied.

Whenever we do individually, then only those pricing prices will apply.

Okay.

Okay.

Now we need to define a new.

But using our right click on new entries.

Take.

The.

Yes.

The schema purchasing arc.

Schema.

Baptism and

the gospel.

And it is the baby, right?

Next

assignment.

Now what is our purchasing organization standard purchasing of?

BD LP will benefit purchasing a standard standard or not a schema purchasing organization.

See here.

This schema purchasing dog will be assigned to standard purchasing automation.

So this DSP one needs to be assigned to DLP DLP.

So we need to send these people now as these people enter.

So this assignment was completed.

This assignment needs to be done right.

So if you want to do the configuration, we need to go to zero change vendor.

Or let's stick to purchasing data and what is D LP right and let others enter.

Here you can see schema glue vendor right?

Yeah.

See here we do not maintain anything.

Blank So it's taken as a standard procedure vendor.

See.

You can see, right.

It is a blank automatically taken.

Standard procedure.

We wondered how it is taken because in vendor C, if it is a blank, it means standard procedure vendor.

Right.

That is the reason why in purchase order, the pricing procedure is determined automatically if it is

a blank.

Okay, got it.

Read how the standard pricing procedure works.

Now let us give our schema vendor DV.

See Delphi Vendor Ascend save.

So now this assignment also completed schema went to our end.

Now this calculation schema needs to be assigned to this particular.

Plus, is that right?

So that's the reason why we have a configuration.

Close this window.

Define schema determination.

Detriment calculations came after standard purchasing organizations.

Go for it.

You can see blank blank equal to standard pricing for C schema, but isn't a blank blankness.

It automatically determines standard price.

That's the reason why it is determined automatically.

Now go with the new entries.

What is our schema group purchasing organization, DSP and schema vendor DV, DV.

So DSP and DV do what we define them for.

Zero sprite.

Yeah.

The LP purchasing document.

Click on sale

now.

The configuration was completed.

No.

I have an output determination.

We define a condition record set among zero for the day.

Remember aman zero for.

So then zero four here we had given some new and we maintain some something like combinations, Right.

Did you do you remember.

If.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

At the same way

here, we defend for record rate for prices.

Vendor price.

We have a pricing pressure concept.

It is also a vendor base.

If info record is not required, then we can use this pricing pressure as a condition record.

See here, I will show you that we have a transaction code called me.

Now.

Mikaela and Mikaela.

See.

Create condition records.

What is the condition type?

We define.

BMW.

D.

W.

DB w.

Bbwaa the standard rate bbwaa is our system and.

Now, here you can see it is a combination game as company called plan partisan coordination Vendor

C 561 We defined a one table, right?

We assigned it.

Yes, yes.

And part plan and budget information.

See, these are the combination tables we have sent.

Let us go with the company code, plant purchasing automation and vendor.

What is the company called?

Demote Limos?

What is our plan?

VP L1 and Delfi DLP zero one.

Bilal What is the Bilal

State seven series one Password rescue here?

It's just not good.

The vendor

is asking.

Which is the unit that each.

Okay.

So I think we need to take material because it's in our record, right?

So we must have a material.

Because we need to maintain the material price, Right?

So let us take where is the material combination available?

So I forgot to mention the material, actually.

If it is a vendor, let us take a material.

Let us take this material.

What is this?

Look at the rest.

Let us create one material combination.

Okay.

Selection.

And even though.

Across the Atlas a reference AMG.

Middle management.

But choosing.

Conditions.

Conditions.

Conditions.

Different price.

Condition Devils.

Right now let's create a new condition.

Table five, six, three.

And this.

Let us give.

Yeah, he had material.

Material?

Plant.

Then we decide,

okay, I can go to all these combinations.

Execute.

See material plant under the table 363 already defined with this aim.

It is telling all these three combinations.

We already have a table 363.

It is showing.

You understand.

Okay, let's take that standard.

Table 363.

Why do we continue to display that table?

Three 1633 right.

Llandrindod Wells Independent.

Let us ascend this table.

An access sequence to access sequence.

What is our access?

You can see the queue right to enter.

So what are the accesses we maintain here?

There is no table entry.

363.

Serial number one two.

What is missing?

Three, Red.

Let us give it three.

3363.

Enter and selected.

Click on fields and see.

It has taken all three fields.

Now save it.

Go back.

Now let us create the conditions.

Slash and

slash for me.

Gave Kayla.

Under the drastic plan to handle material combination.

See for repricing, you must have a material number.

So that it is easy for us.

Okay, let's take one sport.

Okay.

What is the current status?

But that's not how much it is.

₹80, right?

Bilal is maintaining ₹80 in for a record.

Does give ₹75.

The young.

That one box.

It is telling.

Per one box.

Only five of.

Per one box.

It is unfair.

Why?

Because.

Because in Metro Master we maintained ordinate unit as box.

But.

So that is the reason why per one box it is telling sound of.

Sound therapists.

So how much it was that we maintained one box equal to ten inches.

Okay, so that means.

For ten inch bowls, the prices on therapies the vendor is telling.

So let us go with this sound therapy's condition Record sale.

Now let us create.

They purchased.

21 ends.

Mr. Surrender.

Was skilled materials.

See all of this and other info already available, but we created on condition record how the system

is behaving we can see now.

Give me a minute.

Six.

Well.

Wow.

Let us try it another time.

We don't do.

They are one steep hill

and it is under not included sources because the material master data.

We maintain socialist activation, but in source list we did not maintain the any.

Then those.

So let us go for zero one so solution

material plant and.

See.

For Bella, what is the law state here?

And.

C 19 first month 19 is the last date, but the validity was expired, right?

That's the reason why it is showing some evidences.

It is not included in this list where you are creating have this material.

So let us make this three.

Save it.

No, this won't create.

EPL one.

Okay.

Just could not see

See, the ACP recommendation is first its preferences condition record.

If conditions record is not maintained, then the second step the system will do is is there any info

record?

If the info record is also not available, is there any price maintaining metal master data?

It will take it last data and that's one thing.

If info record is not available, is there any last purchase or price available?

It is checking last people place.

Then if the last purchase orders are not available, then only it will go for material price.

That's the system recommendation.

Okay.

First thing is condition record.

Okay.

If condition record is not met there, then it will go for info record.

If the info record is also not maintained, then it will go to.

Lost, but lost people lost purchase order price.

If large purchases are also not available, then it will go to metal price.

Okay, That's the sequence order of price capturing purchase order.

Okay.

This is how we maintain pricing pressure.

If the vendor is having any freight charges.

41.

Guardiola.

Okay.

How much percent is Let's take 5% of.

Prior charges was charging by vendor.

So how much cash we need to pay?

₹3,000.

We need to pay to the vendor along with this price.

75,000.

We need to pay to vendor.

And if we skip giving any discounts, if we are paying any discounts, we can make a discount.

Also, let's see what other standard discount.

See.

For example, let's take a auditable zero.

Okay.

Discount percent is on.

Let's.

He is giving 3% of discount.

See, it will be minus right from December 22 will be minus because it is a discount.

Right.

We know we're getting some discount.

So like that we can maintain so many condition types here.

What are the vendors?

Is giving any discount if we need to pay any taxes.

Also way we are having different condition types.

What taxes us input tax.

We can how to create an input tax also.

And also, I mean, the input tax we give it under.

We need to define in here tax code for having any taxes.

We have a concept called tax procedure.

We will discuss about the tax related activities during the tax process.

Standard.

See here.

This is called manual check.

If you want manual entry, you can check here.

If you want to automatic, you need to check.

That's the control here.

Okay.

And you can see right from one, too.

It is for calculation.

It is for calculation purposes.

What is the discount on?

GROSS is calculating.

It is calculating from one.

Right.

Which is calculating for one.

What is the one means here?

Grasp.

Right.

Grasp not count.

Count.

It is taken one.

One means this.

One grasp.

This one grasp is it is taking graph discount on this gross price.

Okay.

And if they want to calculate, let me show you also, is there any other from one to available see

see here.

Net includes a tax is calculating from 21 to 22 from this to.

This.

It is calculating nothing closer task.

It is a calculation, but from one domains, it's a manual entry.

It is required if you maintain it as a required, it is a mandatory field that is means it is a mandated

condition type.

We thought you are entering the condition type here.

The people will not be saved.

You got it.

And it is a statistical indicator.

It is for some other calculation purpose we use.

This is a body I want to enter.

If you want to enter manually, we need to inject it and check there.

If you want to automate it.

See, we have is coming automatically every time.

Right?

Okay.

That's good people.

Yeah.

It is unchecked.

So that is the reason why it is getting that we have some other options also is called it is how it

is determined here.

If you want to see what is the price increase, it is up.

Click on analysis.

So then it will show you which price increase.

There is a player.

BMW.

Got it.

If we create for any other vendor.

Other than Bilal, if you create too, has the pricing pressure deemed forgeries will not be applied

because we do not assigned it to vendor master record, right?

Yeah.

So let me show you that.

Let me take it.

See it is a bit of a zero.

To see which price is right because we do not send anything to other if it is a blank, it is called

standard pricing procedure, Right.

That's the reason why he's not picking for the Folgers.

You got it now.

This is the configuration where pricing pressure.
