Regarding purchase order.

Today we are going to do the configuration for.

Be.

Let's go under the condition equal to the spring on separate streams.

AMG.

It matters management.

And that's what chasing beer on people is purchasing, right?

So that's why we go to the purchasing.

Yesterday we'd done the configuration and the purchase out of that is purchaser we are doing for.

Really?

Actually, we discussed about it.

Right.

Like under participation, we have two types of classifications.

One is without classification and there is with classification, we go with classification.

Most of the companies will use the classification.

What is the first thing we need to do?

First, we need to define characteristics.

After the unit has entered the class, then we will need to create one release group.

Under this group, we need to assign the approvals, which are nothing but release codes, and we need

to assign both release groups in this class.

After that, we will define we really start this right.

No.

Let's do four carrot sticks.

Okay.

Take.

Betsy, it's.

Let's take the F.

Not that.

It's concrete.

Does the document dated?

That's one chick.

Got additional data.

No.

What is the table here?

We need to go.

Hello.

As it is table we need to give here.

You have to

see

this for purchase order.

Okay.

See, forget about C Siemens communication.

Okay.

Okay.

You take it.

All means it is the table for purchase order ahead of data.

Okay.

But it will miss him, right?

What?

Hello?

I mean, for yesterday and today.

What we are discussing about purchase order.

We are discussing about purchase requisition.

Yeah.

Yeah.

But what we call table.

I'm talking about the table.

The tables are different.

Okay.

Okay, Let me let me show you that.

Okay.

Go for.

Generally, C11 is the typical user by a bypass.

Most of the times we use only a system.

When you go for a table, it is a table for header rate of purchase order.

The parties in government had, which is nothing but parties order that we can see here.

This tables are regarding parties of.

Those properties recreation we use even.

Split.

What is it?

What is this?

We need to communicate with this table so that seven men can see as an initial entry.

Q So you'd.

Okey doke.

Okay.

And doctor document.

What is the document here?

VCR.

And that then.

Document name.

The technical name was BCR.

You need to give here the field name.

Field name.

Right.

Therefore means field.

Field name.

Must be was.

We need to give here.

Be the

exterior.

Also be given like the tone.

Okay.

Click on Enter.

It's taken.

You can see that there's some popup messages about dictionary.

Let's go for the SC 11.

The bendable display.

But there is Bisciotti.

Welcome back.

It is the.

Government.

See.

How long does it take to type characters?

So this one characters, how much of it is or what is this about dictionary?

It's taken as data type as character format and number of characters.

Got it.

How it is taken from the table.

Okay.

Yeah.

It's automatically taken from the backend system.

And yesterday I didn't tell you about this.

Right.

Let me tell you about this.

It is single value or multiple value.

There will be a little difference, but it is today.

I mean, we maintain a single value so that we maintain as multiple values.

Let's see how it works.

Okay.

Multiple wireless.

Go to values.

And that here.

Atticus, how many documents we available here, what document types we request.

We just simply maintain it here.

Which document is we required for release strategy?

We define the end.

The end means.

What is the DNC purchasing requisition?

The description as they refer.

But there's a question.

Let's take another point.

Also, the standard.

Stock.

Not.

This is called a default.

If you select it, we are saying that the classification by classification under release strategy right

there automatically taken the one of the document default.

Let's select how it works.

We can see during the delay said okay, I'm selecting it as default and additional values.

We have maintained these two values during the assignment.

If you want to add another value, we can add over really start the creation.

Okay.

Let's see how it works.

This functionality.

We maintain additional data also.

That's unchecked is not really foreign put restrictions.

It's an option, actually.

If you maintain 032, it's not a problem.

Actually, we are maintaining 032 at a class level, so not required to maintain that here.

We want to maintain.

We can maintain it.

It's an optional.

If you didn't mind.

Also, it doesn't happen anything.

It doesn't have any impact.

Actually, we maintain that class level because during the creation of class, we maintain in the class

type as 032, then the characters we defined earlier, this can be considered as at least as

understood.

Any doubts?

Now click cancel.

This density was created.

So.

Let's go.

You.

Bottom line.

Okay.

The concrete.

Operational additional data event.

The plan was the.

WRP.

Just.

Number of characters and decimal places.

It is taken from the above dictionary to give the currency here high enough.

Multiple values intervals needs to be allowed.

But because we maintained from one to yesterday, we maintain the.

This is in trouble, right?

Right.

3000 to 1.

Right.

That's what we need to check here as well.

Then only it will allow you.

Next.

Get out of them.

Then we can maintain a vision of our results.

Three, two.

Okay.

The concept.

Let me give you a barometer.

But choosing growth.

What additional data you don't get the r.

P.

Let me show you that also.

Let's see what that element was.

The length is three.

See the dentistry character to take one or two values.

Go to Ali's.

Z.

Congressional Republicans need.

Indeed, there will be a lot of purchasing groups available.

So those participants need to be same here.

Can we create a new one?

We lessen it here by purchasing groups and.

One I maintaining only one two.

I'm not maintaining three.

Equal treatment.

And give me a minute, guys.

Hello.

I said, Yeah, now we are going to create a class.

Click on Execute that's going to get the classes three.

The class stage was zero three to right.

Concrete.

Atrophy.

Must be replaced.

Go to characters with other characters with different.

They stopped many times.

Popular value.

And ThyssenKrupp.

Pre-defined the concept.

So we defined one class and the class we defined three characters.

One is document, the second one is total value.

And third one is purchasing.

No setup procedure with classification code to execute.

Go to religious groups.

Yeah.

The Canadian Press.

Because can we give us?

The.

That here we need to give the class name.

Plus the release.

And.

And here we can see Right oral release if you check this box.

That illustrated is applicable for other relays.

If you uncheck it, it is applicable for item release.

We got it.

Hello.

Hello, guys.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Okay.

This is the control for oral release.

Item Ready?

Okay, let us do it.

Item oral release.

Later.

We will go with the item release.

Okay.

Boca Click on sale.

Go back.

Now we need to create a process and release codes.

At.

This could sit on the court.

At stake.

And staying on as if.

Where is it?

But isn't health.

Then a magic number of April.

We can maintain it as eight.

Only eight.

Only the number given by a was eight.

April was not more than eight.

April will not.

Okay, we got it.

But I would just add the maximum limit, what, eight April or so?

Okay, Go back.

Little is indicated.

As we already specified, one is for release, another in Skull BLOCK in the study.

We can go for details, click on details.

After releasing every year If it needs to be a go for a request for quotation, we can check this checkbox.

If not, if we directly issue the appear to people, then we can check this box release for shopping

and field selection.

Actually, the field selection key have a different concept.

Actually, we can see right in Miami 51 transaction we have so many fields, right.

Which field is mandatory field which field is optional.

FIELD So that we can maintain that field selection.

That field selection will be assigned here.

And last time we discussed about the changeable indicators, right?

Yesterday I told you about this, like I will explain in the later session.

Today we are discussing about these changeability indicators.

Hello.

Horrible to hear my voice.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Let me tell you what these indicators were.

We're having five indicators, right?

One is black.

If you do not put any input there, it takes one indicator led.

Then we are having another four indicators, total five indicators.

Let me take.

B, all these options here we have here five options.

Let us discuss each and every option in detail.

The first option is changeable and new release in case of new strategy.

For example, in this strategy we have two strategies.

Strategy.

It is like you created them.

One leg to.

But it's better than 1002.

If people's.

Okay.

In second case.

Second charging greater than 50.

Okay.

And a process.

David.

It.

Three staples, three approach available.

I'm coming to get to them.

Okay.

It is having.

Okay, let's assume these are the two strategic strategies we are having.

Let's assume like this.

So in first case, this strategy, this is the third one.

The strategy.

This is a relationship.

In in one which is in between one K to 50 or else 1000 to 50000.

18283.

And the second rate discharges greater than 50.

Now.

For example, if you are created with.

49.

So what is the release strategy that applies?

It applies to one race whenever.

The amount of parties in the coalition is 49,000 released, 31 is applied, and even a2a3.

All the three other people will release the purchase requisition.

But an example.

After a peer is created with 1496, with some reason they want to increase the price in the purchase

requisition, for example if they changed PR.

Okay, so after a proved it can be changeable.

But they can change anything, quantity or price, anything.

So this is nothing but changeable.

New release in case of new strategy.

It means.

It changed but they change it to.

That says.

So it can be changeable.

New release in case of new strategy.

That means if new strategy is applies, then again it will go to release strategy.

But it is 50 k.

What is the really strategies applied?

Ah one.

No.

So release strategy is not changed here.

So a new release in case of new strategy means this is not new strategy.

This is the earlier strategy.

So again, don't require it to improve by these three people.

It is not required to it release from the start.

Just change it and save it.

That's it.

You've.

Somehow if they change PR from.

49 K to not 50 K greater than 50 k.

Let's assume they change it to 55 k.

If so, then it will apply.

Right.

So then it is changed.

So this condition is the new release in case of new strategy.

It is a new strategy, right.

Is it necessary?

Because rather than replicate the place to second chance, so new release will come and they will again.

Even Will needs to be approved and then a to improve and then a three will approve and then a four will.

Then the beer will be released.

You got it right.

So this is the option for first.

It can be changeable, but new release will happen when it applies to new strategy.

That is the first option.

Meaning?

Now look into this second option and not be changed.

That means.

But an example.

Spear is created with 49,000 strides, one applied.

Again.

If a user tried to change from 49 K to 5059 K, the system won't allow.

It will only display more grammar.

There is no editable mode at all.

We can't change it to the quantity or price.

We can't change it.

That is, the meaning of cannot be changed.

Once PR is created and it is released to pay these three approvals, it cannot be really changed anymore.

That is the option.

Call cannot be changed.

You got it.

Now the next option is changeable.

No new determination of strategy.

That means if a PR is created with 49 K.

And it is got reduced by even a two or 3%.

It can be changeable.

It can be changeable, too.

If it can be changed by 55, it can be changed.

But like anything, it can be changeable, its quantity, anything we can change.

But if we change.

255 k also.

So he's an intern here.

Okay if I change it to 55 K Also if new strategies are applied, but again, it will not go for approval

process.

It's still in related state only.

See no new determination of strategy.

New strategy will not be applied.

It still remains as r one not R to again, new strategy will not be triggered.

Again, it is applicable to R two, but it will not change to are to still in one oc.

If you change it 55 k then it will not go for release it still same in Ottawa and it is in state only.

That's the meaning of this change.

But no new determination of strategy.

New strategy will not be applied if you change anything.

That's the meaning of it.

And next one changeable new starts in case of sorry, changeable new rules in case of new strategy.

The same option C let me show you See?

Changeable new releases in case of new strategy, changeable new release in case of see.

It is a blank, right?

If you do not maintain anything here, it will take in this option.

I don't think we want to maintain particularly then you can choose both options is next.

One is very, very important.

It is.

Changeable new release in case of new strategy or value change.

See?

The same thing applicable here.

See?

Has the same concept here.

If it is.

Okay.

See if we just change it to 49 K to 50 k.

Here.

What happened?

New releases not happened.

But here what happens is if new release strategies are placed also it will be If new strategies are

applied, it will trigger with new release.

If you change any value also it will trigger.

News release.

Big.

See.

Let me tell you what this means.

See?

Changeable.

It can be changeable.

After released that says Zoom.

Created with 40 9k4 strategies triggered on a1a to a 3% approved b r got released.

You got it right.

Now what happens is if it change 49 K to 50.

Okay.

The change in PR 49 to 50 k.

That means you change the value.

Okay, You change the value, it will not go for release strategy.

Anyway, it is only 58.

It is not greater than the ticket, but you change it value.

You change your value.

So again, it will go to 1828.

Also, even.

A April.

If you change value again, it will go for a one for a pro and again heretofore.

Again, eight, three, four, eight.

You got it.

If new strategy is awkward, then it will be triggered with new release orders if you change any value.

Also, it will be triggered.

This is how it works with this option.

Most of the organizations will use only this option, mostly most of the cases, because they change

any value.

They want to know.

Right.

And again, it will go to the release process is a process and they will approve and then it will go

for the process.

This is the.

Think of these five options.

Now let us select with this option or.

Folks lot of.

The prosecution released indicators.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So.

So I'm selecting the fourth option.

And they want to maintain how much percentage that needs to be triggered.

You can maintain it here.

Value change, for example, the new release needs to be triggered when it will change to some 5%,

some 10%.

We want to maintain that you can maintain, you know, maintain as blank if you want it, you can use

that functionality.

Okay.

Any small change.

Also, it will trigger.

Not if you want to maintain some specific percentages.

If it is, for example one.

If it is changed to 10% any surface, for example, it is changed to one like 10,000.

You can maintain the 10% here so that whenever you change it from one to about one like 10,000 and then

you release will trigger.

That is how it works and maintaining it as planned.

Now seven.

Okay.

This is how it works.
