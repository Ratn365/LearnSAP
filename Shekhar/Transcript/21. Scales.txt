Today we are going to discuss about the Scales concept of.

Do you remember the record?

What is the use of record

for record?

We maintain a validated date of the price.

Yeah, it's right.

Vendor Given giving some price to the material, which we are preparing the material.

So in the record also we can maintain some scales over into the record actually recognition as

are able to see screen.

This is a little

sample material for example somewhere

make a simple example so that we can understand better it.

No, I don't know.

What about that?

Could you please unmute over voices, please?

Has it?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Would you please mute?

Yeah.

See, something like the last little stick, but at least the window is up for when the price is ₹100

for material X, for example.

Actually, that's.

And.

We maintained the import record.

But hundreds of.

But in full record.

We maintain this ₹100.

No vendor is saying like this.

If he order.

Quantity.

Thousand rupees.

Then the price will be.

And that would be.

Something like up to ₹2,000.

It is ₹100 up to, let's say.

Okay.

And.

The same quantity from ₹1,000 onwards.

I mean, like 2000 onwards, if you order from 1,001.3 onwards, the price will be ₹90.

And if you order.

Greater than 2000.

The price will be something like a piece.

Okay.

That says if we order.

Rather than £3,000, the price will be a two.

The vendor is saying the terms and conditions like this, they will be giving some price discount based

on the quantity so that this based on the sales concept, we can maintain these prices in any vertical.

Okay.

You understand right.

How the scales is using or the vertical based on the quantity.

If you buy a bulk quantity in any regular shops we get this on discount right in are buying in bulk

quantity.

Not okay, you're not buying thousands actually if it's 10,000.

Maybe it's from 2000.

Let's take it.

Okay.

Up to 10,000.

The cost is ₹100 if it is greater than 10,001.

I mean, if it is greater than 10,000, then the price will be ₹90.

It is greater than 20,000.

It will be 85.

If it is greater than 30,000.

It will be ₹80.

Okay, we got it now.

Any questions?

No, no, no, no, no.

Let me show you this concept in space.

Okay.

Let me log into a subsystem quickly.

That may create new material.

Where.

It's one days later to.

But Jason.

Third location.

One location.

Tokyo Counting.

So you can like.

Let's take a shot.

Each day in the metro group as mechanical.

And it's a pace that Casey and Casey.

But we need to maintain.

But group.

It.

So it.

The classes.

3000.

It says it's ₹5,000.

Okay.

The matter was created.

We.

Let's make it one new one.

Click here.

So a could be not helpful if a group.

Let's take.

It's.

20.

Some say it.

It was too cold.

I said that.

Yeah.

The page.

Italian telephone number registered at.

And that's.

The cancellation account is good and comes with a lot of currency in terms of payment having an auto

number.

Grand certification.

I remember quite a lot of people.

So Darwin was created.

Don't.

It.

Let us create one in particular.

What is a typical foreign protocol creation?

Hello.

Hello?

What is that?

Equal for me?

Double.

Double to give the vendor on metal number, which is information for round table one.

Let me go do this.

These.

I was injured.

Okay, let's take those in face.

Okay.

So the court also created this is when protocol was created.

Let's go to the change mode here.

Both conditions tab.

Okay, We've got the condition that we can see the value from is from today's date because we created

today.

Right.

And go to select this pattern and put the cursor right here and click on choose.

Okay.

You see valid from that one 2022 today's date to from some type plastic.

But one month.

Party to date on February.

If being changed.

Okay.

Yes.

I changed to the very last day 28.

And when there is maintain the price ₹4,000.

Okay, just select selected line item.

You can see that price just selected and head here.

You can see the scales button, right.

Just click on it.

In this case, we're having three types.

One is.

From.

Second one is.

Those came.

Okay.

Darwin is a in the scale.

But I'm scale means from 10,001 onwards, the price will be ₹90 from 2001 onwards.

I'm sorry, 20,001 onwards.

₹85 from 2000.

One onwards.

From 2001 onwards.

That is the type of classes to scale means it is up to.

See.

Up to 10,000.

The price be ₹100.

If you maintain up to NIS up to 10,000, it is taking ₹800 rather than ₹10,000.

It will not take any prices.

If you maintain like that, that is a difference between up to scale and from scale.

The range scale.

The range scale means like 100000 to 2000 will be one price, like ₹100.

At a 2000 to 3000 is ₹90 like that, they will maintain some range.

First, let us try with some skill.

After that, we will do the remaining scenario sets.

These are the types of skills available.

Let's take.

Okay.

We can see the scale quantity here.

Let me go back again.

Set the price.

Click on the case button.

Kinsey scale quantity.

But what is this scale basis?

You can see scale type as from.

Right.

Just put the cursor here, click on details.

Yet here you can see Right.

Scale type as base scale.

It basically means from.

Just understand like this it is basic basic elements from scale

base and base and.

To scale Maine's up and see means not used anything deemed graduated and scale means.

Aveeno skin.

Let us go over it from scale first.

If we start acting as base kill, go back.

It is case, but again that they maintained from 10,000 county onwards.

Okay.

From 10,020 onwards, the price will be.

Something like.

Main, main database.

From 70,000 letters to 2000, 15,015 thousand members, and the price will be nine two apiece.

30,000.

From 20,000 onwards, the price will be 9000.

Therapist.

Okay.

We maintain like this, just click on sale.

The price watch sale.

Now let us create a people.

Especially on May 21.

And.

Or just a random number.

Know, these

November number estimator numbers can show.

And that can go with the 10,000 quantity.

That's plan b1s1.

And that's.

See it is when I enter 10,000.

You've taken nine?

Nine therapies, right?

Where it got taken.

That's the protocol.

This is the protocol.

Number three is into the code number.

Let's pick up a few.

What conditions?

I think we're want to see the scales.

See.

You can see it from 10,000 quantity onwards, the price will be nine ₹90.

And let me decrease one quantity.

Let's see how the cap is reacting.

Necklace 9999 and see it has taken thousand rupees because we maintain from 10,000 onwards the price

will be 990 less ten, 10,000 it will be thousand rupees.

Okay, let me create with 20,000.

30.

15,000.

And at stake, nine, nine, eight.

See 1980s.

Defender 14 Table nine, which takes 990.

If they take 20,000, it will take 9000.

See how it is changing the price because we maintain scales in in vertical.

We understand that.

Any questions?

No vendor is giving that discount in price.

Like if you buy the bulk quantity, I will give you this much.

I mean, this must price of discount for you.

So if you are buying in bulk, it is benefit for you like the vendor is saying.

So if the company wants to buy a want quantity, then it is a benefit for both of.

Because wondering getting a bulk order so you'll be in profitable position and also the company will

be getting.

The materials with a better price.

So that company also benefited.

So.

We from?

From Skelter.

Let us go with the scale.

We go to the change in record and we told.

This.

It's.

So the conditions.

Choose the best period.

Selected.

Go to scale Second.

How to change this scale right now.

I want to change to scale.

How we can do.

Go to the data store.

Although details.

Then you can change the scale type or here.

At select days Blues Can.

Go to the schools.

See, the scale step was changed.

So now up to 10,000, not from 10,000 up to 10,000.

The price will be nine ₹90.

Then up to 15,000.

The price will be.

982, please.

Okay.

Up to 20,000.

I mean, like 15,000, 20,000 means it will be taken in something like that to say you.

Let us.

No.

Slash for your meat.

Don't even.

99 sounded obvious.

Fit.

15,000.

They needed a piece to stick.

Conditions.

See up to 20,000.

It will be an excellent trip up to meals here, 15 to 20000 up domains.

If you take below 15,000, I mean, like in between 10000 to 50000, if you buy, the price will be

an to end database.

See, up to it is taking up to 15,000.

Let's take 10,001.

It takes only the 1982 episode.

Let's see.

So remove one and place it zero.

It will take nine seven database for nine nine database.

You got it right.

How to scale.

What's.

Let us check with the rain scale.

Change to transcript.

We're.

It controls.

But.

So.

Just go to.

Look, I think we need to define one condition for the scale.

Look, I think if you want to know about the condition, we have a concept called pricing procedure.

During the pricing procedure, I will explain about the condition types.

We define the condition types.

Okay.

Today.

Let us create with someone to talk.

You the sit at the window, Michael.

How we are going goes from from scale and up to scale.

And we can also use the range scale, but it is asking the condition.

So we are having some concept called pricing pressure.

In the pricing process, we can define the different kinds of condition types or there.

So I will show you when we are discussing about the pricing, I think within two days we will be going

to do the configuration of pricing process.

The next topic is called output type determination.

And after the output type determination, I will tell you about the pricing procedure concept.

During the pricing procedure concept, I will explain you about the condition types.

We are having this condition type as p BW right here.

You can see the condition.

APB, double zero.

This is a standard condition that we use.

But if you want to use the rain scale, we need to define one more condition type over here.

I will tell you on the pricing procedure concept, how the condition type will be different, how it

is going to play a key role in pricing process, how the pricing conditions are came up automatically

like that.

We're having a concept pricing process.

I will tell you on the.

I mean, I'm in.

I will tell you on the particular concept.

Okay.

Have any questions?

No, no.

If you go for in particular, we have a conditioned stab actually at here.

We can see the prices.

These are condition type.

These prices came from the pricing procedure.

If you drag down and get see the analysis, they click on analysis.

See, this is called pricing procedure where we can have different type of conditions.

PIP zero is gross price and surcharges than the discount we can see, right?

These are common repricing procedure.

What is right charges like during the vendors will send the goods.

During that he will provide some transport.

Right.

We are so that vendor charge charging some freight charges, transportation charges and customs.

If they're doing some import procurement, if they're procuring from other countries, we need to clear

the customs.

So like that, we are having different kind of condition types.

So like first we need to define one condition type for this range range scale type.

Okay.

If I tell you right now, you will be a little bit confused instead.

So let us discuss during the price increases.

Then we got demand from scale to scale or how we are going to use.

It's challenging the concept, but suddenly one day we are going to use share through the general discounts

and the vendors are mostly price maintaining so scales of future business process.
