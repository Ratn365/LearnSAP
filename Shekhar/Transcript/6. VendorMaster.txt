Now let me change some settings.

See, here we maintain no change.

Okay, let's assume the good supplier where it is.

See, here, I will put it as good supplier.

What is the functionality?

You can understand these controls and as I put.

Dis mandatory check.

I check.

Removed from invoice.

How it works.

How the these controls work.

Let us see.

I change I antiquity no change option.

And also I am checked for invoice.

The mandatory option.

Okay.

Let us see how it works.

That means the supplier is assigned automatically in vendor one data, but it can be interchangeable.

More.

That invoice 3% is not assigned automatically.

It's not a mandatory field, but when you assign it, it will take as a note, not tangible more.

See here, let us create one new one.

Excuse yellow one and let me put the vendor.

There's some peppers and.

Simply.

So.

And that's why I maintain that this.

Reconciliation, 16,000.

What do you mean by this reconciliation?

What are the transactions be done against this particular vendor stored under this reconciliation account?

I mean, if you're done, if you procure anything, we need to pay some amount to the vendor.

Right.

So those entries will be.

They got to some general accounts based on this reconciliation assignment.

That was.

Know.

Acknowledgement.

Check this.

I will tell you what is the best I've.

During the I mean, during the creation of transactions.

I will explain you about these controls.

No.

And see what happens when they go through patent functions.

It does not show me for entries.

See, I was representative.

Not shown to see.

See why.

Because it must represent.

But not shown because it is not mandatory.

It may not be assigned automatically during the creation of Vandermeer State.

We need to send it manually, but if you maintain manually it is in non tangible mode.

No change.

And.

But the number is asking.

See internment was assigned, but it has taken it to non change.

One more.

But good supplier is interchangeable more y because we put it as no change and.

Right.

So I put let us go.

Supply is not the supplier.

Good supplier will be some modern models.

We already find modern models.

That isn't what is the supplier.

Okay.

So when we create these randomized data, what is the number here assigned?

It will be assigned to here as well.

I think we defined 7000 to come in.

So it is 2000.

The next number will be generated is 2000.

One will be assigned for these three partners.

See?

Let me see how this randomized record let me be split into two or three.

I don't read all these require only these to

see ordering.

And this is the Shashank supplier Vendor Association supplier and invoice as represented by Samsung

supplier.

But goods will be delivered to the company by Warren Motors.

This is how we maintain the partner functions.

And these are the controls here.

No change are mandate.

And if you want to see the list of vendors, the transaction code is MKB visit.

Let me put this in cognition.

If you want to go with the.

Also not be easy.

These are red dot account.

Click on execute.

So if this were to end, just because we defend only to Windows 7000 but not and Samsung suppliers,

it is his address and this is a purchasing organization the salesperson details.

Okay.

I know.

Let us see.

What is a screen layout, for example?

No one.

See here.

What is the mandate reveals here?

Name is mandatory.

System is mandatory.

Countries mandate, but partial is not mandatory if we do not maintain.

Also, the system is to create the vendor.

How it goes maintain.

We have a screen layout settings.

Let me show you that.

It was just my dad's management.

I mean, during creation of a vendor account group, you can see that accounting.

So if they find a vendor account that connects with what is our vendor account?

Z via Z.

I like this quarter details.

Here you can see last time I already told you peel status.

Double click on general data and address on this address here.

What are the name?

One is a required field.

Such term is the required field requirements.

It's a mandate.

Name one such term and that's country.

Moodle next next group mobile telephone number next to group.

Friends account group reconciliation account is mandatory, right?

And any other things is mandatory contact persons is also optional.

Let me do one thing I will put as the quote is mandatory C partial capacity.

Let me put s mandate.

It is not mandating no digital.

Sea City was mandated in Washington City

and, for example.

See below Box Park City will maintain its mandate.

If you want to go with the postal box, postal code

display means what separate display it is in, not editable mode.

See City It was required field but I changed it to display.

See, we can't maintain any data here.

And the second surprise means the field will be will not be visible to you.

See if they put surprise.

This field will not be visible to see.

See?

The field is not showing.

Postal code and city.

Optional gun control.

Street address country reason she did this show and let me be fresh.

Now it is showing that is a functionality of surplus.

This is how we can maintain, which is mandatory field, which is optional field.

This is about different.

Marshall Did they have any questions?

Joseph On any.

You should.

Joseph, do you have any questions?

Yeah.

Okay.
